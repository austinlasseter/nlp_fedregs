       "0  I think it is a welcome change, if it has been finalized that H4 spouses(certain H4s as defined) can get work authorization. Myself being a working mom and now on H4, and unable to work anymore or find a suitable job closeby, I believe every qualifying person should be able to work and earn his/her money. This will relieve the financial burden on a single working person , and improve overall health of the family and thus the society. Sure I will whole heartedly welcome H4 spouses getting work authorization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1  Thanks to the Government to consider the concerns of H4 dependents.This will motivate and give energy to serve beter in USA for various clints. Also good opportunity to use our skills rather than sitting at home idle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "2  Right step in the right direction. It will provide a boost to the economy. Being forced to be a single income house hold for long doesn't do good for the housing market or the economy in general. The other advantage of this is that it helps integrate spouses to the society and gets them ready when the green card eventually happens.From a personal perspective , it makes the decision to to stay back Vs go to Bangalore a lot easier. No more \"I am sacrificing my career\" arguments :-) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "3  THis is a very good option to bring in ASAP. I am working in USA on H1B. When I got married, my wife who is an engineering gold medalist was working in India for one of the good Oil MNC. As she wanted to accompany me to USA she did a big sacrafice on resigning her good position and job  to accompany me here on H4. As we were not successful to get the H1B Lottery she did her Masters (MS) in NYU university and completed with 3.85 GPA. We are a happy family with 2 kids now. As only reason she is not having a valid work permit she could not contribute any of her skills she studied to make her kid's life better than what it is now with a single salary. THis option will give her a opportunity to utilize her skills she studied for betterment of her, her family and also for this country too.   \n",

       "4  But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
