Please pass this bill. I support H-4 work authorization. Its going to help economy to pay more taxes. It will move job market. Will create more job in all sectors and spend growth will increase of the consumers. ,0,1,2014-07-08T00:00:00-04:00

It is definitely the right thing to do both ethically and economically as pointed out in the Comment ID: USCIS-2010-0017-5602.

I think this is a must have poilcy. There are a lot of talented H4 candidates who if given an opportunity can contribute immensely to the US economy. They are spouses with graduate and post graduate degrees and their talent/knowledge is being wasted because of their inability to work. I think  if this policy is made into low this will be a win win situation for both parties. The candidate will be able to showcase their knowledge/talent and make some money while the government will be able to earn additional revenue in taxes at minimal expense.,0,1,2014-07-08T00:00:00-04:00
"Please make this happen. My wife, has done her masters and is really willing to work and grow up in career as well as life. If this becomes reality, it will really make a difference in our lifes.

Make this law happen.The more we delay the more we face the brain drain. I am a H4 visa holder with just a HOPE(Holding Onto Positive Effects) with this law.,1,1,2014-07-01T00:00:00-04:00
"It will be 10 years since I moved to US! My wife is on H4, and holds Bachelors in Statistics & Computer Science and Masters in Business Administration (MBA)! She has enough experience and education to pursue a position which is high in demand and required in the states. She is staying home from last 5 years which is affecting financially as well our personal lives. I have a son (born US citizen) who turned 3 recently started to send him to daycare and now I am reaching a point where I will not be able to afford all these overheads with one income! 

I have my I-140 (EB2) approved and waiting for the dates to move  and this could be a miracle if my wife could work! 
All that being said, this amendment would be a great help to all of us who are dreaming a better life (owning a house and feel like home) and better personal life's too. 

I am sure this change will positively impact everybody's life and also boom the economy as people start investing here instead of investing in their home countries as they feel that they could stay here permanently. Thanks for the initiation and hope this will be effective real soon!

"We don't have jobs.  We are taxed coming and going.  The economy is fragile at best.  Now this administration proposes that we allow vast numbers of unemployed immigrants to enter the country with NO review of their intentions or history.  Meanwhile our service men are being RIFed (Reduction in Forces) at an unprecedented rate.  Their need for jobs will also tax a system that is not being allowed to generate jobs.
If Congress and the White House wanted to destroy this country, they would do exactly what they are currently doing.
I do not want to see amnesty in any form.  No increases in immigration until this country is once again booming.  At that point these immigrants would not be taking jobs from Americans.  At this point they will.
I have no job and no prospect of finding one.  I know college educated professionals who are working for nearly minimum wage because there are no higher paying jobs.   (No minimum wage hike either!  That may sound lovely to people who don't understand economics, but surely the Congress understands it will only increase unemployment.
The elites in Washington are playing not only with people's lives, but with the future of our nation.  We are not too big to fail.  No country is.    ",0,0,2014-05-15T00:00:00-04:00

This is the way to go in the land of opportunities. Every person, who is legally a resident in the US, should be able to live the American dream if he/she is qualified.

This is a terrible idea. This is just a ploy to replace Americans with cheap foreign labor. This is another attempt by Obama and his corporate masters to circumvent the legislative process.,0,0,2014-05-14T00:00:00-04:00
"THis is a very good option to bring in ASAP. I am working in USA on H1B. When I got married, my wife who is an engineering gold medalist was working in India for one of the good Oil MNC. As she wanted to accompany me to USA she did a big sacrafice on resigning her good position and job  to accompany me here on H4. As we were not successful to get the H1B Lottery she did her Masters (MS) in NYU university and completed with 3.85 GPA. We are a happy family with 2 kids now. As only reason she is not having a valid work permit she could not contribute any of her skills she studied to make her kid's life better than what it is now with a single salary.

"   If implemented it should apply to specified labor categories for which there is a well documented labor shortage.   Since there likely is no such labor shortage however the need for this appears to be to meet political goals and not labor needs.  If that really is the motivation for the change, it should be considered an immigration policy change that is reserved for congressional action and is not eligible for implementation as an administrative action by any branch of the government other than Congress.  Basically this policy change is highly illegal.  

even if this was a part of some more sweeping immigration reform, the policy change seems highly unfair to the huge and growing unemployed population of US citizens that persists since the recession of 2008.  Such a measure seems to fly in the face of all common sense and obligation to the citizens of this country who this government is supposed to serve.  ",0,0,2014-05-14T00:00:00-04:00
It is a very good move by USCIS. I did my Master’s in business administration and then certification program in HR from USA. I used to work in the past but now I am on H-4 visa so cannot do anything. Thank you for considering this policy change. ,1,1,2014-06-11T00:00:00-04:00
I am a Periodontist trained at UNC-Chapel Hill with an H1b visa working as a faculty at East Carolina University. I train future dentists who will enter the workforce and serve the people of this country. My wife is also an international dentist who is on H4 visa. She has always been inclined to teach younger dentists the subject of Periodontics (She has a Master's degree in it from India) but she cannot work until I get a Green card which for people from India takes anywhere between 4-6 years. This rule making will help her get a job as a faculty and teach future dentists while being employed and have a standing in society. I hope there is also a rule fast-tracking Green cards for families like us. Thank You,1,1,2014-05-18T00:00:00-04:00
"In these times of globalization allowing the spouses to work is becoming a trend internationally. Then why not in America! Which has always supported the cross cultural exchange of talent across borders! This concern will always come in between when you compare the work situation and conditions with other countries vis a vis US. People in countries where spose work authorization is granted report positive impact on the employee’s willingness to work as well as on the health and mental well being of the family along with the overall adjustment in the host country.

However the case is just the opposite in America.

I would personally never accompany my spouse to a country that does not grant me the authorization to work.

We all know that USA is one of the most sought after and competitive place to be for any professional. But at the cost of the spouse not being able to work makes it unlikely to relocate to a country where it is difficult for the spouse to get a work permit.

Please consider this reform!

America it’s time to join the league of the likes that support spouse work authorization!

This change entails nothing but good!

"United States is a land of Immigrants. Since beggining US has welcome people from all over the world. Diversity makes this place unique and ever-growing  country. On top of that the people comes legally to US on employment or student based are high skilled and they have expertise in different fields. These high skilled people are in very small proportion compare to other immigrant population and still has greatest contribution in US economy. Almost all private or government organizations there are high skilled immigrants who are contributing their success and knowledge towards this country's development and growth. Albert Einstein and Andrew Carnegie are one of the greatest example of the immigrants who poineered solid foundation of this country. And we, me and my wife are one of those immigrants who came to United States for better future and opportunity and in the hope that we too can make a difference in this world and we too can make the world better place to live. The only thing we ask is to give us an opportunity to prove this and this proposed rule can give us an opportunity to live here and work towards betterment and to make this country and our future bright. ",1,1,2014-07-01T00:00:00-04:00
"I believe this is an important rule that must be enacted to further the objectives of the US immigration policy for the 21st century. Seeing the other comments, one can surmise that those impacted by this bill are eager to have it enacted. However, from the perspective of United States immigration policy, the changes that will be brought upon by this bill, are just as inviting. 

Starting from around the year 2000, the ""attraction"" that the United States has presented to skilled immigrants has been reducing, not just because of the internal issues in US, but also because of the increasing attractiveness of other regions in the world. We, here in US, don't talk about it because most of us aren't as aware of it, but places like Dubai, Singapore, Australia, France, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Canada, among others, have increasingly become extremely attractive for potential immigrants who have the options, knowledge, reasons, and resources for emigrating to a different part of the world. 

One of the biggest attractions for married immigrants, is the availability of employment options for the ""secondary"" or ""dependent"" immigrant (in this case, the spouse). It is ""MIND BOGGLING"", that in today's world, the US immigration policy does not allow these dependents to work. There are very few other developed economies in the world, where such is the case. I cannot point to any study or research or numbers, but I am convinced, that if these dependents are allowed to be employed (and open their own businesses), then United States' attractiveness to these skilled - ambitious, experienced, disciplined, goal oriented - immigrants will GREATLY INCREASE. 

By NOT enacting this rule, United States will continue down the sad path laid down by its archaic immigration rules, further worsened by its legislators' political agendas, and will soon become - however far fetched it may sound on this day - one of the less attractive places in the world to immigrate to.

I strongly support this rule by US government. My humble thought is this will not affect the job aspects of American citizens. There are already immigrants in other work visa's like L1B whose spouses are usually work authorized. But how many of them really utilize that? Its really a choice they make. That applies to H1 spouses as well. And the fraction we are talking here is very less. And they have to go through the competitive interviewing process to get selected in any job they desired to get placed. Lets strongly support that meager population which is still determined and living in dire hope of living their dreams. ,0,1,2014-07-07T00:00:00-04:00
This rule will benefit both H4-Dependent and USA. Many H4 Dependents are very qualified and have no way to keep themselves busy. This is benefit H4 dependent a lot.,0,1,2014-05-15T00:00:00-04:00

"I thank the US government and appreciate the courage from the Obama administration to take action in solving this problem. I see the Obama administration as a Messiah sent to bring salvation to the helpless. I suggest that the autorization to work should be given to spouses if the H1 holder has already being on the job for at least 2 years and should not be tied to when the company has filed for green card or not. There is a alot of politics associated with getting green card from most companies and they sometimes delay filing if one is unlucky.

My wife is on H4, she studied Geology but cannot work. Although I have a good job on H1B, we recently have contemplated leaving to Canada so she can have the opportunity to contribute to humanity. Several of our american family friends visited us and tasted the food she cooked and they suggested we should seriously consider opening a huge restaurant in the city. of course we are interested in such but our common reply is that ""she's a stay at home mum"". At this point she can't use her degree and cant use initiatives to start any business venture. Most of us are in our 20's and 30's and these are very critical growth years of youth which need to be invested. Utopia has suddenly become discouraging at close range. I therefore think it would be a great blessing to the US if our spouses can be given the chance to live life fully. Thank you Barack Obama as you take steps to set us free and may God help you too and God bless America !",1,1,2014-07-10T00:00:00-04:00

There are multiple individuals with masters degree and prior work experience which can very easily be brought to realization if this bill is passed.  There are so many jobs in our country which require experienced and  fully qualified workers which are not readily available in plenty, which mandates training period to educate an individual and prep them to fit for the job opportunity. On the other hand we do have the individuals with the required skills and experience as h4 candidates who can readily be deployed to the US job market if this bill is passed.

"It's is good news that we finally have a proposed rule towards H-4 work authorization. This was long overdue. It doesn't make any sense to apply for Employment based LPR's and wait years (& even decades!) for the visa numbers to get current. Mean while, dependents on H-4 can't work until LPR. People opposing in the name of unemployment should open up DICE and look for the number of positions and why can't these be fulfilled in a timely manner. Adding few 100k new workers to the booming economy isn't really a bad thing.

"Compete America hereby submits comments to the notice of proposed rulemaking entitled, “Employment Authorization for Certain H-4 Dependent Spouses,” that was published on May 12, 2014 in the Federal Register by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).  This proposed rule would fulfill an intention announced by the Department of Homeland Security in January 2012 by permitting work authorization for the spouses of certain H-1B nonimmigrants who are in the process of achieving permanent residence in the United States.  The rule would apply to the spouses of H-1B workers who either are the beneficiaries of an approved immigrant visa petition or have been granted an extension of H-1B status beyond the normal limit under special legislation designed to ameliorate the negative effects of lengthy green card backlogs (sections 106(a) and (b) of the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000 (AC 21)).

It is a miss-assumption that all H4’s will take away jobs from US Citizens. It is a biased opinion from people who want to block this amendment from being passed. In reality, not all H4’s are qualified for this rule and there is also a strong possibility that they might not even seek job. With the new rule in place, it will have a very marginal impact to the total USA workforce.

I do not want more foreign workers. We have an abundance as it sets. That is the reason for the low hourly rate and the high unemployment. We must protect our borders stop the influx of undocumented workers and dry up the magnet of jobs and housing. I want our jobs left for the American people. I want to reduce the number of unemployed to 6%. We the American People have fought against bringing in more guest workers or any other increase in immigration every time it has been pushed forward whether it was you or another president in the last 20 years. We do not want more low income workers to drive down the cost of business and provide them the opportunity to pay less per hour. We have many unemployed and our financial system is not strong enough for taking on more people. Adding to the number of people at the bottom of the financial spectrum will not improve things for anyone and it is not in the interest nor the desire of the American people.,0,0,2014-05-13T00:00:00-04:00
"I am an immigrant and i work in a small town. My wife always worked before marriage. Once she is married and was in US getting her H1 was one big achievement and always finding a contract was another (since we were not ready to live in two different cities). Now after 4 year of ups and downs my wife decided not to work. The instability was too much for her to handle.
If we knew we could both work without any immigration hassle we would have bought a house and might have settled knowing some part of the future is safe. Even after 8 plus years in US i am not sure one day I would require to go back to my home country for some immigration rule.

After marriage I came here on H4 visa, obviously I knew I will not be able to get work authorization, but I was aware that H4 EAD rule is already in pipeline.And I am really glad that the proposal is in its final stages now. Issue of not able to get work authorization here has affected me and my life in many ways and I want to put my thoughts why is this rule so important for everybody:

1) Firstly as I mentioned I was working for 4 years back in my home country and have got good experience and exposure of the work in my field.With my hard work and talent i have continuously contributed to company's growth. So I am very sure, given a chance to work here in USA, I will be able to contribute in the same way, leading to growth of my employer here.

2) Secondly, With 2 paychecks every month, I can buy house,car,cloths,groceries,insurance pay utility bills generating more and more tax revenue and contributing to US economy.

3) Thirdly, while staying here on H4 visa, I have prepared for competitive exams like GRE and got really good score. With more savings I can have capacity to pursue higher education to hone my skills, and in turn contribute in a better way to the US economy.

lastly I would like to say, I don't to be hurdle in my spouse growth, his contribution to economy here. In fact I want to support in all the possible ways mentioned.

I'am mahi.I did my masters in Computer science and Engineering. I hate to be idle. I want to do some work to keep me busy and that should be useful for others too. I love working and i like to spend my own earned money for my needs. It is very boring to be here to be idle and not doing anything. Seriously we need an authorization to work in this country. I have also tried some volunteer work. But as i can't able to own a car it is much difficult to go there and i'm in need of my husband's help to get down to their place.I cant able to go to india as my husband is working here. So please give us authorization to work here.As he applied for gc I cannot go back to my own country.I think that this rule should be implemented and to authorize us to work here. The only one way other than this is I have to earn one degree here and to start applying for job. But i already have done masters and the schools are not allowing to do masters in the same field. So it is very hectic in my situation. I cannot do anything and my life is too boring to be idle without using my knowledge.,1,1,2014-07-14T00:00:00-04:00

"Never late than ever. I am a well sought after engineer and working my way to be an entrepreneur in Silicon valley. I currently work at a Top tech company. Me and my fellow engineers are essentially building intellectual property and cutting edge products that will help sustain U.S.A its world leadership in technology and thereby bolster its position in world economy.

I have been in U.S.A for more than ten years and my employer is helping with processing a Green Card for me. Recently I got married and my wife joined me in U.S.A. She currently cannot work in U.S.A and this is leading to a myriad of problems. Just think about a person sitting at home all day when the rest of the society is doing something. That person's psychological state is not very good for a healthy family and society.

We realized this. I started looking around for options. Unless Green card visa numbers are available, or H-4 spouses are given Employment authorization, our situation wouldn't improve.

So me and a bunch of other engineer friends in the same situation have decided to move out of USA. Recently Canadian Immigration authorities were wooing Silicon valley engineers and entrepreneurs. Also there are few south American countries which are developing nations and want good skilled workers in the technology department. We currently have few options and by the end of year 2014 or early 2015, we will decide on a Nation which will not have the restrictions U.S.A has.

While we respect U.S.A as a nation and am currently helping it to build it further. We wouldn't do that at the cost of our families. We rather build a nation which helps our families.

U.S.A! do you want to retain highly skilled Immigrants or loose them to a competing nation. Think about it, if it is not for the scientists you got during World War, you wouldn't be the U.S of A that you are right now. If it is not for the hard-working engineers and entrepreneurs, let me tell you, U.S of A will be just another nation in the world.

My name is Dharika Bhavsar, and I am a Registered Nurse of Virginia. Nursing is a passion of mine that is sowed in the depths of my heart. Nursing is a passion that allows me to serve my community and to be a light during someone's dark disease process.

I am also looking to grow personally by pursuing Nurse Practitioner course, and since I am lack of the United States work experience, I am not eligible to get admission. I want to reach a diverse population and teach proactive measures through practice and community awareness events. I am most certain that with work permit and allowing me to complete the Nurse Practitioner program will help me achieve my goals and allow me function as a proficient ""extraordinary"" advance practice nurse.

With my past extraordinary performance, I am confident that I will succeed in the Nurse Practitioner Program and I will then open my own clinic. Focusing mainly on underserved populations where healthcare, preventative education, and follow up care is so desperately needed. I am excited to help others and to give back to a community I live in and love.

Decades of waiting for the green card process is making the skilled people loose their skills, their confidence, their individuality and stressing the whole family.

Please do not get carried away by comments like ""I support this law"" which is overwhelmingly by Indians, who will benefit from this proposal.

Please consider the plight of Americans, and citizen students, who will be affected by this flood of new EADs, and limit it to people only who have been here for a long time, like 6 years or more and have applied for Green card, and approved I-140, and are just waiting for their Priority number to become current. This is the only way we can limit the number of applications for EADs and make sure, that people who have been here for a long time, and are really close to getting a Green card, get EADs for their dependents. Not just anyone with a simple I-140 approval. This is only fair and will limit the number of EADs to only people who deserve it.

"I think this a great step by the government for many reasons:

- It is necessary if America wants to retain highly skilled immigrants, who contribute significantly to the American economy and also create jobs. More than 40% of the Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children. Small businesses owned by immigrants alone employed an estimated 4.7 million people in America.

- It increases the spending power of immigrant families. According to the Center for American progress immigration reform could support and create up to 900,000 new jobs within three years , just from the increase in consumer spending. This bill gives them an opportunity to contribute more to the local economy.

- It is just and it is right. Article 23 of the United Nations declaration of human rights states that everyone has a right to work with no distinction being made due to national origin. America is where families live, make friends, go to school and in-spite of staying here permanently for years and being highly qualified to work such a basic right is taken away from them.

I have penned down my thoughts in detail here: https://medium.com/@revant8888/fe5ac8a74a93. ",0,1,2014-07-02T00:00:00-04:00
"I will be pleased if this goes through. We have lot of talent wasted with H4 dependents unable to work in the US due to the restriction. I am of believer that good talent should not be wasted. This is a good move by USCIS to enable some of the young minds out there who want to fulfill their AMERICAN DREAM. This will in turn help the economy to get more skilled workers. This would mean some of the semi-skilled workers may not compete but right job should get the right candidate for the growth of corporates as well as the country.

There were several of my friends and family who had successful job and careers in my home country but had to give away the dream and ambition so that they can be with their spouses and kids don't suffer the separation of parents. Several of them had to go back to continue and pursuit their careers. Although this is good for financially but will also help those individual who are willing and capable have a mental freedom and not dependent for every small things.

With raising living standards as well as living expenses (inflation) in USA and rest of the world (especially the home country of H1B holders), one-member-earning for a H1B-family in USA is getting less and less lucrative to move to USA. For USA to attract and retain talents on H1B, work authorization for Spouses is much needed. May not, if the strategy of USA is not to attract/reduce the best talents from across the world. Both have its own positives and negatives; unless positives are leveraged with right strategic plans. I don't deny the fact that any country should take care of its citizens first.

We know which of the two economy would prosper more in the long run, it's fundamentally wrong to think that economy only has so many jobs, jobs get created everyday - majority of jobs that we have today, were never there 50 years back, and it would be hard to picture jobs of future; but not the economy that would be leading the way when that time comes.

I  appreciate the rule that is posted. Previously I was working in India but after coming here I was not able to continue with work so I was very worried that I'm losing my career. This rule is really a boost up for me. But it would be great that this rule can be applicable for all H4 spouses even if principle H1 is not seeking lawful permanent resident like the current rule for L2 candidates. ,1,1,2014-05-14T00:00:00-04:00
An awesome proposal. Please implement this ASAP. Good for the community and economy.,0,1,2014-06-02T00:00:00-04:00
"This is an extremely positive step in strengthening the US Immigration system & addressing the plight of thousand's of H4 dependent spouses, who even though being extremely talented are not allowed to work. Below are my 2 cents on this proposed rule:
1) This rule would increase the attractiveness of the US Economy among the highly skilled workers (compared to Australia, Canada, etc.) & also help in retaining the people who are already on the path of lawful permanent residency.
2) Boost the US economy by providing employment opportunities to highly skilled H4 Dependent Spouses and thus reducing the dependence on H1B visas.
3) Provide double income opportunities for the families of immigrants and have a stable and fulfilling life in the 'Land of Opportunities'.",0,1,2014-05-15T00:00:00-04:00

"When I was looking at the comments, those are mostly from the H4 dependent spouses. I am not sure legally can they comment on rule from which they are going to benefit ? It is like proposing a rule to award legal status to illegal immigrants and ask for supporting comments from 11 million illegals. Obviously they will say YES and say they want it. I question the legality of this method. I am not sure if comments from non citizens should be considered valid.  ",0,0,2014-05-22T00:00:00-04:00

On a personal Note: Its frustrating not able to work after all those years of education and hard work just to stay here with spouse, I have always had a dream of having my own restaurant and I still believe in that dream, but its far reality at this point because of never ending EB-3 wait times. My wife is in fact more qualified than I am, With this new rule we will be able to fulfill our dreams and lead a meaningful life.

"Dear Officer,

I am a Registered Nurse in the state of Nebraska. I graduated 3 years ago from Nebraska, but I have not been able to work because I am an H4 dependent spouse. I also possess a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology and a minor in Chemistry that I acquired from another U.S based University. My husband is a medical scientist on H1B visa for the American Red-cross and pays his taxes. I often hear about a nursing shortage and yet people like myself with a US nursing degree are sitting at home simply because we are from a different country. We did everything right and maintained a clean legal history in the US for the last 12 years. I Know there is thousands of H4 dependents out there, who are even more educated and professionally trained who are in the same position that I am in. I believe we are professionally trained and we have a lot to offer to the US, allowing H4 dependents to work is the right this to do, morally, economically and for the betterment of these hard working families.

"I was going through few of the comments and observed that people are against the law harping on the issues of 'foreigners"" & ""un-skilled workers"". Am surprised that people are not reading  the proposed rule and just reacting to hearsay!!!

The rule clearly implies for people ""who are in the process of seeking permanent residency"" - will they still be considered as foreigners in the long run!! In that case there are many American citizens who are not born in America, what we will consider them!!

Again this law, if passed, will grant work permit, but one cannot work or have job if you are not qualified for a position. People say there are unemployment, but on the other hand there are vacancies too - why those positions are still vacant? Simple answer is there are not many qualified people to fill those positions.

Being said all, I myself hold 2 Masters degree including MBA from top Indian Institute and used to earn 6 digit salary back there. Being on H4, I am simply a housewife now, wasting all my education & experience. I was told from Childhood that AMERICA IS A LAND OF OPPORTUNITIES- I still believe in it.

"Hello -

I strongly support this rule as proposed by DHS. The population of H4 spouses that this rule addresses should be granted employment authorization. They have been staying here ""legally"" for several years, and are a part of the American future in many ways. They are ""American families in waiting"".

This rule will integrate them into our system in a more effective manner for the following reasons:

1. Most of the spouses are in the prime years of their working lives, and many are well qualified, so it will be beneficial for everyone to use their skills and talents productively.

2. By earning an income they pay more taxes, contribute to social security, etc. And they are not mere consumers of the local community resources.

3. Rather than repatriating to the home country due to the uncertainties of a single income, employment for spouse encourages more spending and investments here.

4. Long stints as a stay at home parent or housewife causes huge mental/emotional/financial strains and eventually affects the whole family including the kids.

5. These are individuals and families that are willing to work hard, and have great hope and enthusiasm in the American Dream. Why delay them??

Don't just look it at one side of the coin, look at both. People are so selfish they just think about loosing their jobs due to the increased number of workers, but that's just not true, because of this competition you might start working better and can become a manager or some other higher level officer.

"This is a very welcome proposition both in the economical sense and humane sense. All of the non-immigrant families who come under this category are single income families which means they tend to be extra cautious in terms of their spending for security. However if the spouses were to get employed, they would be more willing to spend, buy a house, car etc. This would definitely have a trickle down effect on both main street and wall street opening up more employment for non IT workers. On the other hand, many of these spouses are well qualified individuals who are unable to work just because of the current rules and if this proposition comes to effect, it would go a long way in plugging the needs of the industry to find qualified workers where there is a deficit like in the software sector. This would raise productivity and business for these enterprises which in turn means more profits and thereby more taxes to the government. It also has a humanitarian touch where the families would feel more secure and gives the educated spouses a chance to express their education and feel valued. We all know America is a land built by immigrants, and this proposition only shows the way forward for these spouses to be inspired and be the hard working immigrant that we sorely need.

H1B spouses who have talent under STEM are sitting at home and waiting for this new rule to be formed. This will not only help H1B families to grow economically but will also help the spouses (it would not be wrong if i say that most of them are women) to go out and work like everyone else.

This is a very important decision which can bring a very positive reform in lives of dependent spouses.(Read mostly women).

Most of the women I have met who are on H4 are as educated and some having previous work experience in the countries they come from. Most other progressive nations such as UK do allow the dependent spouses to work while they are living there. Doing an economic activity and earn the living should be the most basic right for any individual. It helps in progress of an individual, a family and then to progress of a nation. I keep hearing even American women complaining lack of women workforce beyond a certain percentage. By not allowing Dependents to work , we only see more women getting stuck at home whose primary responsibility becomes child care, cooking and other house hold activities, again forcing the social division of 1900s indirectly.

Attracting highly skilled immigrants is one of the key competitive advantages which America has over the rest of the developed world, and this proposal should further strengthen that advantage. I personally know several immigrants who returned to their native countries because their spouses could not work here. The concern that this will displace American jobs is mostly fallacious. This is the lump of labor fallacy. An economy is not a fixed pie. A lot of the highly skilled immigrants are key contributors to American companies and they are job creators as well. For instance, a good chunk of the companies in Silicon Valley are founded and powered by immigrants. This job creation and high productivity helps expand the economic pie for everyone in the US.",0,0,2014-05-29T00:00:00-04:00
"This rule would provide an opportunity for the spouse's who are on H-4 visa to contribute to the US economy and in the process realize their dreams/ambitions and doing justice to their education. This rule would provide a win-win situation by helping US Economy gain through skilled applicants and also for the spouse's to contribute to their families/realize their dreams. After a much awaited wait this rule seems like a oasis in the desert. Hence, I fully support this rule and would urge/plead to pass this rule at the earliest. ",0,0,2014-07-14T00:00:00-04:00

RIN: 1615-AB92
Title: Employment Authorization for Certain H-4 Dependent Spouses
 
Top reasons why I think USA would get benefited by employing high skilled workers like me
 
1) Strengthens the overall economy and grows U.S. GDP as every working individual contributes by earning and in turn will spend more and more towards items ranging from day to day stuff like salt , sugar , Gas to bigger ticket items like buying home , car . This in turn can trigger a chain effect which can help not only me and my immediate family members but also the other hard working people of United States who would be part of the Eco system 
 
2) Fosters innovation and encourages more job creation and job growth in the U.S. by allowing skilled workers to participate and contribute who in turn will be working as hard as any other workers. They will invent or contribute towards new inventions (I myself have published Papers in IEEE journal which is one of the prestigious Engineering group), start new ventures (Statistics can reveal that there are lot of companies which are founded by Immigrants like me).

3) It is well known fact and lot of studies also have indicated the contributions to innovation and growth made by immigrants in STEM fields, where development of world-class talent will be critical to America’s continued global leadership.
 
There have been lots of times when me and my husband thought of moving back to our home country but decided against doing that for following reasons.
 
1) When you have a choice to live and work in the best country in the world, why to settle for less.
2) Unparalleled Education system for Kids that breeds future scientist, researchers, doctors, Engineers and Entrepreneurs alike
3) Best in class Health care system where anything and everything can be cured or controlled. We have personally benefitted by US Health care system when I was going with health crisis.
4) Higher Quality of life which cannot be matched in any other place to a common man. Living a life with quality as one can experience in United States is a dream for billions of other people and we are step closer to make it our reality.
5) Above all, the fundamental freedom that this country provides to everybody irrespective of color, race, religion and allowing to you to be yourself and allowing you to express yourself is unmatched in other parts of the world
6) Last but not the least, the chance it provides to interact with the people of this country without whom this place would not be what it is today.

This Rule will give basic rights for many spouse's who can now come out of shadow/home and make their career and livelihood better & create their own self identity not depending on their spouse for everything. 

Imagine,you being in USA for 8-9 yrs on H4 and don't even have SSN,(with current Rule) doesn't allow H4 to get one.Its Insane! 

I am on that boat, My wife currently on H4 and cannot work even though she has science background. This rule will enable my spouse to get her career back on track which is stopped in past 8 years.This rule shall boost morale of lots of Non-immigrant families who are stuck in GC clogged backlog process. The way currently GC backlog, I was planning to move back to India so that atleast she could work and be part of economic growing by paying fair share of Tax to indian economy.

With this rule in action, it will give us world of confidence in this broken immigration system,help us to make big decisions to settle back in USA by investing here such as buying new home,new car and work on our dream startup company, will create jobs and boost economy. 

With both working, we can pay fair share of tax to US treasury and can be part of boosting US economy also we can afford to provide better education for our kids for future study in USA. By providing EAD to those certain spouses who are already in line for permanent residence process along with their spouse GC process;they are possible future US citizen(in line).By providing EAD in advance will help build our life,economy and future of this country into right direction.

I've kept up with technology, although it hasn't been easy to do, and my ability and skills are well-honed. That said, there can be no doubt that any expansion of immigration (or even non-immigrant visa programs) is driven by the desire to increase the supply of relatively less expensive labor (many of whom enjoy non-monetary compensation working in a country that is considerably more politically stable than their native land). Efforts to expand such programs must be halted.

"My spouse is a doctor from India. Over the years since we got married in 2005, she cleared USMLE exams, which required us to send our first new born (2 month old) kid to India for almost a year so that she could focus on her exams. That was the most challenging and heartbreaking thing to do, specially for her as a mother, but it was something that needed to be done so as to get a chance to pursue a career which she has worked so hard for over the years. After clearing all the exams, and applying in tons of hospitals for residency, she didn't even get a single call for interview. We did knew it is going to be tough going into it as neither we had Green card, nor were we US citizen. However, never did we thought it's going to be almost impossible. It is extremely disheartening for a professionally qualified individual to sit at home, and see all her education, and dexterity go to waste, specially when you see all your colleagues back home scaling great heights of personal and professional satisfaction.

"The USA does not need a new rule for Certain H-4 Dependent Spouses.  THe proposed rule would be detrimental to the  health of the US economy, where over 19 million American members of the April 2014 workforce are actually or functionally unemployed (U-6, Dept. of Labor).  Many of these unemployed Americans are receiving government benefits of various kinds due to their unemployed or part-time employment status.
Increasing the US labor pool now, at a time when millions of current citizens have still not recovered from the last great recession would in fact prolong what is already factually acknowledged as the longest economic recovery in 80 years.  This unemployment is a severe drag on the economy; the resulting lack of confidence continues to aggravate the 6 year slowdown in housing sales and new construction.
Additionally, adding more workers at this time will have the effect of further depressing wage growth in the US at a time when many are calling for mandated increases in wage rates and the reduced exporting of jobs by US companies due to lower cost labor overseas.  Arbitrarily Increasing the supply of any commodity or input, including labor, will only depress wage rates and increase deflationary pressures on the weak US economy.

"I fully support this rule. It really is very beneficial to the immigrant families that have played a significant role in maintaining the technological superiority of US. Imagine a spouse having multiple degrees but confined to the four walls of home because she does not have work authorization. It has caused several married women that are on dependent visas, going into depression, torn apart families and has become a source of major pain and distress. 

This is a real example of my own wife: She pursued her MS from a reputed Ivy league school in the area of physical therapy, she applied for H1B visa FY2014, she could not get through the lottery system. Though, she has multiple job offers and also PT License to work in multiple states, with her OPT expiring she does not have any other option other than to converting to a H4/Dependent Visa and stay at home. She is very depressed and unable to comprehend her situation. She has to wait until April of next year and find a employer who can sponsor her H1B visa and she should subsequently win the lottery in order to work from October 2015. Which to me sounds very unfair and to some degree not humane. I work for a fortune 10 company in the area of engineering working on some cutting edge products. I received two of my professional degrees (MS and MBA) from US universities. I love everything about US (Weather, people, work, culture, opportunities) but this situation with my wife is really making me rethink if i have to stay in the US or return back to India or pursue opportunities in Canada. With a very fluid situation on the immigration front here in US, i applied for canadian permanent residency 2 years ago and received it recently in last september. 

While some people tell me on my face that I am desperate to stay and settle in US, I can shamelessly not deny that fact. Ever since i received my undergrad degree in india, for the last 10 years..i received rest of my education, work experience in US. I formed significant professional networks, made personal family friends, accomplished several things. I owned 2 homes, paid taxes, never got into trouble with the law, contributed significantly to the american economy in various forms. All I am requesting for is that the US immigration take a more rational and morally correct stand on the issues of H4 EAD for dependent wives.

Availability and creation of jobs are not going to be stagnant. I hope, definitely this initiative will create more jobs as many people may start business. 

Many of them (H1&H4) can even pursue their dream studies with the additional support from their spouse. Currently we can’t manage their higher education along with our kid’s studies, home expenses, rent, auto/health insurance, car loan etc with what we are earning.

H4’s are just contributing a small percentage of total strength ,so no need to worry about grabbing someones jobs etc. Everyone are human beings irrespective of their Visa status & educational qualification and Survival of the fittest is nature’s law, so who ever proves should get the priority irrespective any other criteria.
 
Those H4’s are also in the process of getting citizenship and they will also be part of this country may be in another 5-10 years. I really doubt how much they can contribute to their family and to this nation after sitting idle for these many years.

1.	The work force created once this rule passes is almost negligible, only 0.064% added in first year and then it decreases drastically over years
2.	People working on H1B visa are afraid to make investment in US due to obvious reasons, as only 1 member is earning. By passing this rule it will help American economy is many ways. Few examples could investing money in buying houses, buying automobiles for driving to work. Spending more money as both are earning.
3.	When H4 starts earning they are going to pay more taxes so this is another boost for American economy and taxes are paid every year so this is recurring money being injected in US economy
4.	The cost associated for implementing this rule is negligible and is not going to cost tax payers money. So that money can be used for other useful purposes.
5.	US companies , when hire and train H1B employee, they are investing so much into employee. If this rule passes then H1B employees will not think about moving to other countries or homeland and thus US can benefit from brains of those. This is one way to stop braindrain.

I have been in US IT industry for more than 6 years and I would like to clarify some of the comments.

Citizens will lose their jobs because of this rule: We all are hearing that Americans will lose their current jobs if this rule is passed.  I am surprised to hear this since no company will fire an experienced resource and hire a new resource and train them. This will happen only if the new resource is very cheap, but how can we say that people who get EAD will work for less salary? Don’t they have to support their family like everyone else?  I am having hard time understanding this accusation. 

Market will be flooded with Fake candidates: You think Interviewers are dumb and they can’t figure out whether a candidate has genuine experience or not? Most of jobs are asking for Face-Face interviews now a days. Even if the fake candidate manage the Telephonic round, they can’t get through Face-Face interview.

We will have lot of competition for new jobs:  Competition will definitely increase when new pool is coming into market and only the best will win for sure. Good thing is, this competition would force everyone to improve their skills. If any employer wants to hire for a position, they clearly know what qualifications candidate should have. If the employer can’t get candidates with that experience then most likely that job will be outsourced instead of compromising with less skilled resource

Another thing people are saying is, companies prefer Indians over Americans. Almost all companies in USA are equal opportunity employers. They are not supposed to discriminate anyone based on their race/religion. Is that not illegal if they do? Why anyone would show partiality for foreigners? FYI, Immigrant workers in IT are not cheap.

Any organization work to increase their profits by cutting down expenses. If they can’t find a resource for the budget they have, they will look for other ways to get work done by outsourcing the work. Would that benefit our economy?  If there are two resources, one citizen and one immigrant with same skill set, then everyone goes for citizen because of their communication skills. Very often most of immigrant workers lack of good English skills. That makes a lot of difference in an interview.
On the other hand, this rule will bring lot of fresh talent into market and that will force everyone to increase their skill level.

The corporation has to wait for one full year to get the candidate on board plus all legal costs associated with the H1b filing.

Are these corporations not concerned about their profit - why would they take so many efforts if there are local unemployed STEM graduates right here ready to work?

4. If it was so easy for a foreigner to do 3 month testing course with fake resume to land up a job here in USA, then why don't your unemployed citizens also take up the 3 month testing course to land up with a job? 

Your claim that some one else gave the interview, then how is it that they sustain their jobs - u mean some one from overseas comes and performs their work everyday or the corporations who hire them are so blind that they are giving money away to someone who doesn't know ABC of their job?

5. H1B workers are the top paying tax bracket. These are the people contributing to the growth and paying taxes. They are not here just because they happen to be born in this great nation but they are here only on the basis of their skill and hard work.

"Hello Sir/Madan,
I strongly support this rule. This would ensure that H4 visa holders can leverage their skill set and add lot more value to the various industries and in turn contribute much more to the economy of US. It will also surely go a long way in improving mental balance and stability of all such H4 visa holders who feel miserable for not being able to contribute significantly to the industries.",0,0,2014-07-08T00:00:00-04:00
"This is a great step and I believe it is fair justice to give work authorization to H-4 dependent spouses of principal H-1B non-immigrants who are in the process of seeking lawful permanent resident status through employment.

I am currently on H-1B and have an approved I-140 and my spouse is on H4 Visa. She has a PhD in STEM category and several years of work experience at her home country. In-spite of her talent and skills she has to sit at home because of the Immigration laws of not being able to work on H-4. 

Recently, I have been planning to move to other countries which have better immigration laws in providing equal and fair work opportunities for the spouses. This rule gives us hope to stay in the United States and live our dream.

It would be valuable to encourage educated legal aliens to apply for permit work and contribute to the economy, rather than restrict them. It remains a backward and non-progressive policy and it needs to be amended in order to encourage skilled workers to remain in the United States.

Lot of deserving and talented people on H-4 can contribute to the US economy by working in the energy conservation projects and innovation projects that could help save millions of dollars for the US government. Also they would actively contribute towards economic growth by investing in homes as spending power increases so that they can buy with confidence, pay more taxes to the State and the Federal Government.

Lift US Economy: By fueling innovation and growing the economy not just within the country but outside with other competitive countries who are challenging the US Economy, and this very much is possible and will not be difficult ""IF"" the Immigration Reform is kept only as an option.

Skilled H4 Visa holders who have an equivalent US degree will make a way to continuous Innovation and contribute to the Economic growth:
They say ""Change is the law of life"" it becomes necessary to grow by bringing in change and diverse in traditional learning techniques. In the past skilled legal non-immigrants have supported the living standards and also have supported the type of jobs given to them. We have seen that qualified legal non-immigrant visa holders have been paying more taxes without receiving more benefits.

When they become legal Immigrant, you can find how much they have bought human capital, financial capital, and build relations to gain positive opportunities abroad. With all this good outcomes why is still U.S. policy so restrictive? and is holding back for the betterment of skilled immigrants or legal non-immigrants. 

Develop New adaptable Learning techniques: When we talk about Diverse people and culture, we first need to start it within an organisation that has a voice which will lead to innovative ways of communication from every part of the world. Making it easy to understand and kill the communication barriers by developing and designing such learning content which is very diverse and easily understood.

Create jobs: Given a chance sooner, a qualified educated H4 visa holder will be able to create jobs.

According to a source:
As for start-ups, a 2007 study by researchers at Duke and UC Berkeley found that 25% of all U.S. high-technology firms established between 1995 and 2005 had at least one foreign-born founder. In 2005, these new companies employed 450,000 workers and generated over $50 billion in sales.

"Hi,

Thanks for strategically looking at this case- industry demand vs available supply... 

Here is my situation and i am sharing only my personal perspective.

I am employed with Software giant working with a Tier 1 Bank in technology field with I140 approved for past two years. 

My spouse is a very passionate environmental & sustainability professional with a masters in environmental sciences. 

After moving to US, she could do little to nothing-not even volunteer in environmental groups/agencies. She had so many ideas- very simple ones to reduce carbon footprint...but cant use or share it for some tangible results....

Two years ago we decided to bite the bullet- do one more masters program in US-  enrolled in 1 year fast track Columbia University's Masters in Public Administration program specializing in sustainability management. We ended up spending close to 75-80K. 

During this time my Green Card process didn't move any further.. 

After graduation, she got calls from NIKE, CANON, GOOGLE. KPMG, etc but the moment they heard she needs sponsorship she was disqualified.. Companies say they are equal employers but this is farce.. That was very frustrating..

We wanted to buy a home and settled down once my spouse gets through with job but that didn't happen. Most of her classmates from Columbia University moved to China or even LATAM countries for exciting opportunities. 

Fast forward one year later, my spouse is still out of job even though we spent 75k and she has niche skill set of helping global organizations reduce carbon footprint and make business more sustainable than ever !!!! 

We are seriously contemplating to move to neighboring Canada or even Australia by end of this year, where she could work. My organization will be able to transfer me in a month's time. 

I am watching this rule closely and if nothing happens by end of this year, I personally would hang up my boots in US for good. Maybe other countries deserve our skill set.

My only request to you is this- If you are passing this rule- pass it or if you are not passing it, publish it so that people can make a decision. You have every right to decide future of your country either way-  but out plea is that you  communicate..

"This is truly a welcome change to the legal immigration process and will make the lives of thousands of long-suffering applicants easier. I do have some concerns about some applicants failing to qualify under the rules outlined because they are in between the various stages of the immigration process. 

The intent of the process is clearly to provide relief to the H4 spouses of applicants whose immigration process is well underway and proof of permanent immigration comes from the following stages crossed by the primary H1B applicant:
1. An approved I-140 
2. Extension of H1B under AC21 106(a) and 106(b)

Employers often revoke an approved I-140 if the primary H1B leaves to work with a different company. Under the proposed rule, the H4 spouse will now (after the I-140 gets revoked) not be eligible to apply for an EAD card even if the primary applicant has already received a 3 year H1B extension by using the approved I-140 (before it is revoked). 

This becomes a loophole in the rule since there will no longer be a valid I-140 for several months (or longer) to provide as supporting documentation for the H4 EAD application. Falling in this grey area does not take away the fact that the high skill workers have taken significant strides in the immigration process. Rejecting such H4 EAD applications will be against the intent of the rule - which is to provide incentives for high skill workers to stick with the immigration process by providing work authorization to their spouses. 

Hopefully, the letter of the law (and the supporting documentation required) will be flexible enough to allow the spirit of the law to be interpreted and applied accurately.

"Conditions for H4 EAD are in disparity between L1 and H1B worker. While both visa category allow foreign workers to contribute to US economy, but their spouses have unequal situation. These conditions are also compelling foreign worker to start Green Card process, however not all H1B worker or their employer may choose to gain permanent residency in US. However it doesn't mean their contribution to US economy is insignificant. US is home for many software startup companies. The lifespan of a startups before they make it to IPO or acquisition is mostly 3 to 5 years. And startups need more skilled workers than any other well established company. But AC21 condition requires minimum 6 years time before H1B worker's spouse can work in US, which is more than turn around time for any startup.

"This is a long-awaited, much needed and highly anticipated move by DHS. It has been long due and rightly so for several reasons: If American government and or DHS wants to retain immigrant workers who have lawfully applied for green card or permanent residency, they need to understand that these workers have families that are part and parcel of their lives and a healthy, comfortable, and stable lifestyle requires for their families to be eligible for the same rights and status as their counterparts i.e. the H-1B workers. If the needs of their spouses/families are not met in the United States, this will discourage these specialty workers on H-1B from staying in US and will demotivate them even further.

If the spouses aren’t eligible to work, they will not be able to form any relationships in the country like other eligible workers do such as having coworkers, colleagues, business partners, etc. Additionally, if a highly qualified and well educated person sits at home without being able to work, it will not only cause frustration and sorrow, but also limit their chances of being hired in future as they have been out of the industry for so long. It could take several years before the H-1B workers get their EAD/green card and hence making their spouses ineligible to work for several years while they’re waiting. This is further detrimental to their career and restricts their employment potential.

The humanitarian aspect:  By not allowing employment for a spouse of an H-1B worker is almost equivalent to keeping someone captive and ineligible to exercise their rights. This is actually unconstitutional – by allowing someone to enter and stay in the country indefinitely – and yet not providing them equal rights as their counterparts or American citizens/permanent residents for that matter. Granted, the H-1B workers are ineligible to vote until granted citizenship, but they still get to work and pay taxes just as any American citizen would. And yet, they pay Social security and Medicare taxes which they have no claim on as Americans do. All in all, the H-1B workers are more than paying their dues to fund America and deserve at least equality in status and a happy family life. That’s not too much to ask – or is it?

By allowing the spouses of H-1B specialty workers who have lawfully applied for citizenship/green card, the American government is not just ensuring stability and motivation in the lives of these workers, but also gaining additional revenue in Visa fees, taxes, and top notch quality of workers who are well educated and willing to give their best to the country and its people. This is a win-win situation for everyone!

Docket No. USCIS-2010-0017

I support RIN 1615 – AB92(Employment Authorization for certain H-4 Dependent Spouses)

Agency: U S Citizenship and Immigration Services, DHS.

Action: Proposed Rule.

I support because it is very beneficial for US Economy in several ways like:

1.	As EAD(Employment Authorization) will give H-4 Dependents right to work, thus they will pay taxes and contribute to US economy. Most of them are highly skilled, so there skill can be used by the corporates for the development and growth.



2.    Passing this rule will also help to retain lots of H1-B talent in USA. Due to long waiting time for  GC(about 10-20 years) many H1B’s with high education from USA are migrating to other countries like Canada, Australia and their home countries, as their spouses(high skilled with many having high education from USA) can’t work. Not able to work status of H1B spouses is also putting lot of financial pressure on families.



 3.   Passing this rule will also create more jobs, As EAD will allow H-4’s to start their own business, thus increasing  employment opportunities.



4.   Passing this rule will not flood job market and leave less options for the American Citizens, as this proposed rule RIN 1615 – AB92(Employment Authorization for certain H-4 Dependent Spouses) clearly states that : The Department of Homeland Security proposes to extend the availability of Employment Authorization to certain H-4 dependent spouses of principle H1-B non-immigrants. The extension would be limited to H-4 dependent spouses of principal H1-B non-immigrants who are in the process of seeking lawful permanent resident status through employment. This population will include those H-4 dependent spouses of H1-B non-immigrants if the H1-B non-immigrants either the beneficiaries of an approved immigrant petition for Alien worker(I-140) or who have been granted an extension of their authorized period of admission in the United States under the American competitiveness in the 21st century act of 2000(AC21), as amended by 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act. This Regulatory change would lessen any potential economic burden to the H1-B principal and H-4 dependent spouse during the transition from non-immigrant to lawful permanent resident status, furthering the goals of attracting and retaining high-skilled foreign workers. 


As per the above proposal these certain H-4’s will eventually anyways get their EAD’s, thus by passing this rule job market will not flood. This rule is important to pass because of long GC lines and huge backlogs(taking about 10-20 years to get GC after application) which is leading to migration of H1-B’s(whose GC is already applied by company as he/she is important to company) to migrate to other nations with more flexible immigration laws.

When this rule is implemented, I would be able to join my family , be selective with my employment choices as I am no longer required to seek visa sponsorship. 

This rule would certainly make lives of several spouses bit easier, allow them to earn a living with an employer who is solely looking at his skills rather than his immigration issues.

All of this without any public debate.  We do not have a shortage of high skilled workers!  These employees will be here for years under contract with a particular company!  Then to allow their spouses to work is insulting to Americans even further; so these workers will have 2 pay checks while most American families will be lucky if they have 1 part-time pay check.  It does not help America while foreigners are given the jobs and in our own country there will not be jobs for us. None of this is even rational.

"This new rule proposed by the USCIS will be a welcome change to the current immigration system in the United States. I have resided in the US for 8 years now. I completed my PhD about 4 years ago and I was eligible to work on H1-b visa for a government entity (cap-exempt and non-transferrable). Later on I had to quit my job to be with my husband. I interviewed with at least 10 employers and every single time, they liked me but could not hire me since I do not have a green card or U.S. citizenship. I tried understanding the reason for their unwillingness to sponsor a visa for me although I was a great match for the advertised position, and in most cases they just did not want to deal with the necessary fees and paperwork to hire me. It was never due to my qualifications (at least not explicitly).

I was unemployed for about 9 months and I applied to a Masters program. The reason I applied to this program was to primarily keep myself occupied. Upon graduation, I do not have guarantee that I will get employed by another employer. I am highly skilled and would be an asset to most organizations in my field. Even though I am qualified to have a green card in EB1 category, that process typically is restricted to those who are already employed. It is unfair that I cannot do anything about it. To me having a job is of utmost importance since I am passionate about what I do and I have spent considerable years of my life pursuing higher education.

1. Humane Aspect
I am from a lower-middle-class family from a small Indian town. Not many parents in a situation similar to mine afford to send their daughters to college. But my parents sacrificed a lot making sure that both my brother and I are well-educated. They supported all my education and I could obtain a Master’s degree in Computer Science. I still remember how proud my family was when I started working as a lecturer upon receiving my degree. I worked in India for 3 years before getting married. For the last 6 years, since my marriage, I am on H4 and unable to work. I cannot overcome the thoughts like “I wouldn’t be able to rebuild my career after such a long gap” and “all my hard-work and my parents’ sacrifice is going in vain”. I request you to return my dignity and give me an option to work. Plus, if it is not passed, my US-born son has to leave his country and relocate with us back to India.

2. Retaining Talent
My husband and I decided to relocate back to India since we didn’t want to wait for another 7 years for getting an EAD/GC. My husband expressed this to his American employer and his employer told us about this rule. We are looking forward to it since it is our last hope.

3. Beneficial to Economy
If this rule is passed and I get an EAD, I will start a local business. Thus, there will be a few new jobs and more taxes to the government.

"With the enforcement of employee-employer relation, there is hardly any h4 to h1 cases anymore. So, ALL(I can guarantee) H1bs especially that have come to US with F1-H1-EAD-GC path are legitimate and are truly skilled with 3.5+ above GPAs. Hard working candidates. Now, there is no guarantee that their spouses that may be talented are really needed by the US companies. As soon as they get EADs, after a break of min 4 to 6+ years, it is difficult to be sell-able in a competitive market in the US.So, their first option would be body shopping, which means placement without having much experience.
I do not support this rule since we have worked really hard to be in the positions where we are right now. There was a time when we(both my husband and I) were doing management consulting and application management services at the client locations through high profile American based consulting companies established in the 90s or even before that. These consulting companies followed the rules of the visa, really had the client openings and did not post ads to get candidates for NO future jobs etc, paid us on time, paid for sponsorship, had conference calls to discuss feedback, had clear rights to hire or fire, and even on our timesheets. Even then, we were so scared of going to India for stamping because of the nature of small low profile body shopping consulting companies. IT industry needs consultants, it is the nature of our industry that projects do come in and go and we need temporary workers and high talent for the end clients to consult, get solutions and then let go or change projects, but this needs to be legitimate and for legitimate candidates and legitimate consulting companies, not body shopping companies. Though consulting is very attractive to me where I adapt myself to a client and gain a lot of knowledge, because of visa stamping fear, I have moved as a FT employee now(which I enjoy but not as much as consulting). But, my husband is still consulting hoping that USCIS/DHS/Consulate will approve or stamp his visa in home country by looking at F1 stamping atleast.

This rule will be a major boon to qualified H4 spouses. This law would benefit those H4 spouses who have good educational qualifications to contribute to the US economy and also support their H1B spouses. Today H4 spouses who are qualified to work are unable to do so due to visa restrictions, forcing them to stay home, losing their self-confidence and self-respect.
With today's processing timelines it takes H1B holders more than 6-15 years to get their EAD/GC, during which these qualified H4 spouses are forced to stay home. Many H1B holders are eventually forced to move back from the US due to such restrictions which have personal and financial impacts on these legal, law-abiding, tax-paying immigrant aliens.",0,0,2014-07-01T00:00:00-04:00

This follows the availability of employment authorization to dependent spouses of other aliens, such as L-1A visa holders.

Once she realized she had no chance she started thinking of pursuing Masters in Science in her field so that because of F1-OPT visa she can work here for some time. She prepared for GRE and TOEFL exams and applied to some local universities. Finally she got acceptance from one university which was 300 miles from where I lived. To save her career we both decided to go with long-distance relationship for about 2 years. This was painful period in our lives as living apart was not easy.

"I strongly support this rule. The H4 Visa is considered a curse for dependents by most people. I would like to state a few among the many reasons for supporting it. 

1>The H1B Visa holders consitute a very important part of America's workforce and it is in the benefit of the country's economic and future interests to support the H1B Visa holders and their spouses on Dependent H4 visas. Many of these spouses are highly qualified and have given up a comfortable work environment to be with their families in the USA. It is not an easy decision for such families to go back after each partner has spent half their respective lives between the US and their home country.

2> It is very frustrating for the spouses under the current restrictions of the H4 visa, wherein they cannot work or study if they wished to. Even participating in their hobbies/interests on a social platform becomes a challenge as the restrictions on a dependent visa are too many. This is very contradictory to the very idea of America.

3> Apart from their fair share of Income Tax, H1B visa holders also contribute to their share of Social Security and Medicare Taxes which they are not entitled to benefit from, unless they become American citizens. An approach towards letting the spouses work would at least help them supplement their income, since they are already deprived of unemployment benefits during bad times.

4> Making major life decisions become a challenge and causes families to return to their home country to start afresh or splits families apart between the two countries. It is the need of the hour to update these archaic laws and I commend DHS for having put forth such a proposal. You have to think about the people who are already contributing to the economy and making a difference, and help provide them with a backup source of employment.

5> Implementation of this rule could help give a jump-start and give the economy the push it needs so badly. There are several instances of people known to me who have been waiting for some kind of positive sign in order to make investments, as major as buying a house or setting up a startup. Although this is no even close to getting a much awaited  green card, it needs to be noted that most of these are people who aim to become American citizens one day. By helping them we are only helping future American citizens and creating a stronger system.

6> A sizeable number of such families have children who are American citizens born in this country, and as such it complicates life decisions at every step. By providing an opportunity for employment, the country will be building a stronger and more experienced workforce, since this will allow these already qualified people to build up their careers and skillset along the way.

"Dear DHS,

Please, please do not give blanket EADs without any safeguards whatsoever . These EADs will be misused
by Indians with fake resumes and they will apply for a job in any field, and just not in high labor shortage areas.
This will have a huge impact on the citizens, students and minorities competing for a job. Obama administration is 
supposed to stand for citizens and minorities. Not for a proposal only benefiting foreigners at the cost of citizens and minorities.

Please , include enough safe gurards. The EAD applicant need to go through an LCA similar to H-1b, be an occupation where there is shortage or the unemployment is below a threshold. and are paid the prevailing wages. These safeguards are a must before an EAD is issued to an applicant. The employer needs to ensure that they are not preferring a foreigner over a US citizen, by offering low wages. Please, please limit the EADs only to occupations where there is a shortage, which is what a H-1b is intended for. Also, include an LCA requirement to get an EAD.

Also, there is practically no upper limit. Anyone with an approved I-140 can apply. What is the realistic upper bound? What if congress increases the H-1bs in the future? Some of the proposals include tripling it. Then we are looking at triple the number of EADs. Please include an upper limit. Once the EADs reach the upper limit, no more EADs for that fiscal year. This should be similar to H-1b quota.

Also, why was the requirement that the H-1b needs to have spent 6 years and have an approved I-140 dropped, just for am approved I-140. Who are we helping here? We should only provide EADs to people who have been here for a long time, established a work history and are extending H-1b, and are really close to getting a green card. Not just some new H-1b who got an approved I-140 in a matter of months, especially with premium processing. Please limit the EADs only to people who have been here for a long period of time(> 6 years) and are extending their H-1b based on AC-21. This was how it was proposed 2 years before, and this made sense. This new blanket EADs is dangerous and we are just inviting massive number of people to apply. The AC-21 extension after 6 years must be a criteria in addition to an approved I-140, i repeat both of these should be a requirement. This will put a realistic limit on the number of EADs as well as provide EADs to only people who deserve it and who have been waiting for a long time. Please consider this.

One more addition could be, only people whose priority data is more than certain number of  years(5 years or so), can apply for EADs. This will make sure that people who just barely got their I-140s cannot apply until they waited for a longer period of time.

In summary:
1. The AC-21 extension along with approved I-140 should be the criteria.,
2. Limit the EAD occupation to high shortage areas, not a blanket one, which is a major blow to citizens and minorities.
3. Employer should file an LCA and make sure the prevailing wages are paid, before an EAD is issued.

"I support this regulation! If passed, this would give the educated/skilled H4's to resume their careers. 
 
I would like to take this opportunity and mention my wife's struggle being on H4, as an example:
----- My wife has a Masters in Computers Science and worked for a multinational consulting/auditing company in India and has 8 years of overall professional experience. We got married in 2011 and she moved to USA on H4. She did not try for a job in the first year, but started looking in second year and unfortunately no one would hire her because she did not have an active work visa, and finally when an employer was ready to sponsor and hire her, she did not cut the lottery and it’s a dead end. She is depressed, having all the right skills she is unable to work and just sit at home as a home-maker.
 
I understand that visa and immigration is not a “right” but a “privilege” and a non-immigrant can’t question the process, but with all due respect some policies really need to be reviewed and rewritten, H4 category being one of them; Currently, what good an H4 visa holder is helping this country apart from being legally present (talking purely in professional terms and not personal)? Here we have extremely skilled (mostly) people coming to this country on H4 visas leaving their careers to be with their loved ones, just to sit idle at home. 

Here are the Pros with this regulation:
• H4’s will immediately start contributing to Medicare and Social Security which are severely under contributed with the current employment rate.
      o According to Social Security Administration, Social Security reserves will be depleted by year 2033 
         ( http://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/ ) .
      o According to Center for Medicare & Medicaid services, Medicare funds will be depleted by year 2026 
         ( http://downloads.cms.gov/files/TR2013.pdf  see page 12).
• H4’s will start contributing to Federal and State taxes and I don’t think I have to mention the advantages of more taxes to the government.
• With earning power comes the spending power - H4’s can fuel the economic engine by spending on purchasing the cars, houses, other properties, investments, 401K, shopping, vacationing etc.,
• Instead of bringing highly skilled workers through H1B program, the skilled workers are right here in the country; this would reduce the pressure on the H1B program (which has its own set of flaws and drawbacks).
• This regulation would definitely reduce the “reverse brain drain”. There are few families who went back to their country, just because the spouse cannot work.

There is an argument that this regulation would marginalize opportunities for Americans, I respectfully disagree with that argument; in this competitive world everyone has to go through an interview process, and just because the aspirant is from a certain nationality doesn't guarantee the job.

Finally, this regulation would have some possible loop-holes if implemented:
•	Indian software consulting companies and Consulting/Staffing companies in The USA are utterly notorious in abusing H1B visas and US immigration system, and this regulation would definitely open a new door of exploitation. 
     o The companies are infamous for paying lowest dollar to their employees, job starved H4’s would fall as easy prey.
     o With the recent tight restrictions and competition for H1B visas, consulting companies are visa deprived; this regulation would open new opportunities for the companies to misuse the workforce.
     o The companies could hire an H4 for a skilled job without proper interview process and underpay the incumbent - in other words they can hire any tom-dick-harry for a skilled job, because no one is watching them (supposedly).
     o Just because the primary H1B is working in their company, they can allure the respective H4 to join the same company and in the due process they can bargain the salary below market rate.
     o The companies could bring in H1B’s to the country with false promises of EAD for H4. And most of the first-timers have no idea about the rules.
I request you to keep some sort of regulatory control on this EAD process and companies like these. 

All in all this is a great regulation for the skilled H4’s to pursuit their American Dream.

"Thanks a lot for considering to provide EAD for H4 dependent spouses and I strongly support this rule! 

I came to this country in 2005 on H1-B with my spouse. My spouse had a bachelor's degree in Food Science at that time with 4 years of work experience. Since she was on H4 at that time, she was unable to work and build her carrier in US. Instead of sitting idle at home, she went ahead and pursued a Master's degree in Food Science here in US. Because of the Master's education in US, she was able to migrate from H4 to F1 visa for the duration of time she studied and built up additional work experience by leveraging the OPT/CPT options in F1 visa. However, after she was done with her Master's, getting a H1-B was very difficult in the Food Science domain and hence she had to get back to H4 visa. Now she has been unable to utilize her skills and contribute to this economy for the past 5 years on a H4 visa due to lack of work authorization.  My permanent residency has been filed in EB-3 category 6 years back and based on the recent progress, it might still take several years for us to get a green card. We love this country and do not want to look for other opportunities outside. 

There are several other qualified individuals on H4 visa that I am aware of, and are wasting their skills because of the lack of EAD. This rule will help individuals like my wife and others to pursue their carriers in this land of opportunity and feel good about giving back to the community.

"VERY GOOD RULE AND I SUPPORT IT. Many Americans feel that adding these 100,000 people to workforce will reduce their chances of getting jobs which is incorrect. I would like to point out that the H1 spouses who qualify for this rule generally take the jobs which either the Americans do not want or do not have the expertise to do it. In such cases those jobs will obviously land offshore to India, China or some other country. This way the American economy will not get any benefits and will even loose on that revenue and taxes.
Also the H1 spouses who qualify for this rule will as it is be eligible to work in 2-3 years when the I-485 is applied, however by bringing this law now these families will have a sense of stability and start investing/spending their savings on homes, equity, cars etc. which will further boost the economy. Currently, since the H1 spouses cannot work there is less stability for these families and hence most of the savings of H1 employees is invested back in their home countries and U.S. looses that money completely. Hence this law needs to be implemented asap.",0,0,2014-06-03T00:00:00-04:00

My wife is on H4 visa since past 5 years and we have had to go through a lot of financial and mental pressure due to her inability to work and earn her own living here in the united states.

She came here with a notion that America is the land of opportunities and she is being denied that just because she decided to marry an H1-B visa holder (a person she loved). This is totally unfair and will even deteriorate me from staying in the US for a long period of time. No one wants their life partners to suffer mentally due to their inability to earn their own living and freedom just because of the fact that they are on a certain ""Status"".

I don't think I need to reiterate the economical advantages this law can have. There will be more tax paying workers, more high skilled jobs will be filled by people who deserve it. This law will in no way endanger the jobs for US citizens.

"Most of H-4 dependent visa holders are women in their twenties and in almost all cases they hold professional degrees of their own and very much would like to persue their dream careers. The present system forces them to take full time stay home wife status, sacrificing their professional career for living with their spouses. Education and aquired skills outdate by the time they receive green card after 10 or 20 years of wait, which leads professional failure haunting throughout their life. Many times this situation leads to boredom and eventual depression leading to personal and family problems. Without an opportunity to work and persue professional careers spouses are forced in to mental and emotional stresses. H4 status in the present form forces these young bright women with good education and skills to giveup their dream and stay home, for which they worked hard to acquire skills and invested money and time to go to school. Eventually families with these problems leave the country and go to places where both husband and wife can work and persue their own professional careers.",0,0,2014-06-16T00:00:00-04:00
"I am writing to support this rule and speak from behalf on thousands of H1B’s spouse holders who are ineligible to work in US due to the current law that prohibits them.Given the nature of this law, it is vital that this law to be passed and allow spouses of H1B holders to work. These are spouses with some highly advanced degrees and rich work experience that can bring a lot on the table.US has been and will be a land of opportunity and it sure shouldn't be restricted to handful of people, everyone deserves a chance.

"A big THANK YOU! to the president of United States of American and to DHS, finally someone has realized the plight of H-4 spouses. Even though this is not a job but a fair chance to find one after 6+ years on h-4. It is a welcomed step towards providing fair opportunity.

Many people who have commented here do not realize that American is a country of immigrants and if America wants to be competitive it needs to attract best talent from where even in the world. In this global economy where America and American companies are selling their products and services around the globe, America cannot just close their doors. Fairness and common sense of justice prevails in this country ( e.g. judiciary system) and that I believe is one of the strongest plus point that will keep American in the right direction. Also people making comments in here need to realize that this is just giving opportunity to the H-4 spouses after legally staying in this country for 6+ years. It does not guarantees any job and many of them may not be able to find a job in this environment because of not being in the system for all these years. This just gives them a fair opportunity to work if they would like to and are able to find a befitting job.

My other request would be to make all priority dates current after an individual has been in the process for x years, this will help all individuals stuck in the green card process for years to at least get EAD. EAD will give then freedom to move to other companies and not get exploited. Moving from one company to other between the green card process is a complex procedure.

Highly skilled non-immigrant workers who move to the US on temporary work visas like the H1-B usually bring their families on dependent visas like H4. The spouses of these workers are usually equally well educated and skilled. Currently this half of the immigrant population are a drain on the US economy as they are unable to contribute to its growth despite being skilled and capable of doing so. Also it is ethically and morally unfair to ask these dependent spouses to choose between family (coming to the US) or career (staying back home away from their spouses).

a.	America needs an overhaul of the immigration system. Although this rule is not a replacement for the comprehensive immigration reform; it is an interim measure to bridge the gap to retain high skilled future permanent residents/citizens. The fact that Immigrants have fueled the economy a lot need no further argument. 

b.	This is not a blanket work authorization for all H1B workers, but a smaller subset of high-skilled foreign workers, whose employer wants to retain them because of their skills and has already approved I-140 to be permanent resident of this country, but are waiting indefinitely because of the fractured system in its current form.

In my opinion, this rule should be extended to the primary H1B applicant as well as all dependents including, children.

This population will include H-4 dependent spouses of H-1B nonimmigrants if the H-1B nonimmigrants are either the beneficiaries of an approved Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (Form I-140) or have been granted an extension of their authorized period of admission in the United States under the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000 (AC21), amended by the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act (herein collectively referred to as “AC21”) (1)

"Don't you think that we have MORE than enough aliens in our country now? Americans have been finding it difficult, if not impossible, to find employment because of all the legal and ILLEGAL aliens for several years now, and many have lost their homes because of their non-working status! There is NO general shortage of high-skilled labor to justify this proposed rule, and I know for a fact that many Americans would do the jobs that these aliens are filling.

My brother, for example, committed suicide nearly three years ago because he had been unable to find work in the two years preceding his death and was losing his home and everything he owned. His health was going downhill because he could not afford healthcare. So his way out was a bullet to his brain. The area in which he lived was over-run with legal and ILLEGAL aliens who filled all the available job positions. In fact, at least one farm employer that I know of PREFERS aliens over Americans because they work for less, work as many hours as the employer wants (many times into the night with lights in the fields), and can be talked to and cussed out by their bosses without fear of retribution.

In addition, the aliens ~ both legal and illegal ~ are putting a heavy strain on our school systems, our health systems, our Welfare systems, Medicaid, and Food Stamp program. Many Americans cannot obtain free healthcare, but the aliens can. Is this what America has come to? We certainly don't need any more aliens than we have in this country now! In fact, we need to deport the ILLEGAL ones!

Many aliens are also responsible for a lot of the crimes in our country. Check the prison and jail inhabitants! 

I have also read that the H-1b visa-to-green card process is problematic in and of itself, and that firms are being coached on how to ""NOT find a qualified and interested American worker"" so that they can hire an alien.

"The activity of Scientists, Technology specialists, Engineers and Mathematicians, a group that we call STEM workers (or sometimes Scientists and Engineers) is the main input in the creation, adaptation and adoption of scientific and technological growth. That, in turn,has been connected to economic productivity and to its growth.

More businesses/companies than ever are looking for workers skilled in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math. Despite the continuing caution exercised by many companies amid ongoing economic uncertainty, a substantial portion of employers in the U.S.  Identify a lack of available skilled talent as a continuing drag on business performance. Manpower Group's seventh annual Talent Shortage Survey looks at the extent to which employers are having difficulty finding the right talent, what jobs are most difficult to fill and why, concern over stakeholder impact, and what strategies employers are pursuing to overcome the talent shortage. 
U.S. employers are struggling to find available talent more than their global counterparts, where 34 percent of employers worldwide are having difficulty filling positions.
According to the more than 1,300 U.S. employers surveyed, the positions that are most difficult to fill include Skilled Trades, Engineers, Scientist and IT Staff, all of which have appeared on the U.S. list multiple times since the survey began in 2006. The survey also highlights the most common reasons employers say they are having trouble filling jobs, including lack of available applicants, applicants looking for more pay and lack of experience.
And one other main challenge or difficulty the companies are facing is the immigration process. As when the companies/Recruiters try to fill the job positions they come across highly skilled/talented professionals who they are not able to recruit and fill the position on time due the lengthy/expensive immigration sponsorship or timeline. At times they are not even able to sponsor H1b due to the cap unavailability. This leaves companies no other option but to reject the job application. Most of these job applicants (skilled/talented/experienced) are H4 Visa Candidates who are dependent on their Spouse H1b visa, the H1 does not allow their dependents (H4 Visa holders) to obtain a work permit or even a social security number. The problem is amplified on the fact that H1B holders from India who file for a permanent residence have to presently wait between 10 years to 70 to obtain a permanent residence. This implies that people are now staying on H4 sometimes for 10 years.

Conclusion:

Many Surveys show the companies continue to struggle with the talent mismatch and too many employers become complacent about the talent shortage and ultimately they will struggle to realize their business objectives. On one hand we see how companies/recruiters are suffering and struggling to fill their job positions, And on the other hand we see there have been many Skilled/Talented and experienced H4 Candidates who are willing to contribute their skill and talent to the companies and to the country are now sitting idle at home as they were not given opportunity or not authorized to work.
Passing this bill will be WIN-WIN situation for the country, Companies and the Immigrants( H4 Visa Candidates)

So I fully support this Bill.
I would like to see this bill soon to be a law.

The rule needs to define clearly the risk: If H1b holders lost jobs, will their H4 dependents with EAD are still eligible for work??? If yes, what is VISA status for them? If no, How the employer knows the situation? will there be a mandatory inform process by H4 EAD holder to notify their potential employer that they can not work because h1b is terminated?

"May be this is a good move for those who are eagerly awaiting for their dependents to start working, but in the first place shouldn't we ask ""are all dependents aren't the same ?"". 

Secondly, Under what job categories H-1B dependents entitled to take up jobs once they have EAD ?

Third, Will it boost US economy ??

Bottom Line: There are other ways (i.e., like graduate in a specialized field from US university and seize an job opportunity) if one is determined, unless one would like to work for an restaurants, gas stations, nanny  etc.  

This decision will kill the US job market & also will destroy the US economy system.

"Why give  work permits to anyone when so many Americans are out of work, more cheap labor!.  It would be mean decision to allow more  more foreign workers looking for work.  It would be mean to your brothers, sisters, fellow  Americans..   

There is no general shortage of high-skilled labor to justify this regulation, or any industry.

The new visas would apply to all U.S. occupations, regardless of whether there is a need for more job seekers or not.

The H-1b visa-to-green card process is problematic in and of itself, with firms being coached on how to ""not find a qualified and interested American worker""; 

1) As an example. Recruiter  listing  job requirements with  outrageous amount of qualifications for even skilled experienced candidate to fill!

2) The foreigners multiply.  iI you hire Hispanic foreigner who is legal  into a city job (like a CA department job in city I refer to)   And this person gets promoted to department head in city...Hispanics who are head of departments tend to hire only other  Hispanics.  Soon the whole department is only Hispanic.   And then they make comments...oh  Hispanics and foreigners will do the work no American will do.    

3) Other proof,  my husband was Electrical Engineer B+ average graduate of big 10 University  with  numerous programming languages and tons, years  of experience.   

He continually noticed that hired foreign programmers needed lots of help from him  on programming languages or conceptualization of finished product.  Sometimes he would ask them about their assingnment  and noticed they had no clue or answers to his questions.   Foreigner programmer would take home  this same work and  mysteriously going from nothing to finished product and the foreigner couldn't explain the program or process.  And on top of it all, program never did what it was supposed to.   So, this means they hired someone to do the programming outside of work, and it still didn't work.   

4) There is no shortage of engineers,  just a shortage of wannabe low paid engineers.    85% of new graduates in engineering are not finding work.  

5) We don't neet foreigners or their spouses looking for work here.   I think the story about the wives is BS.

 Unemployment problem has been since ages and will not go away any time soon.Smearing this bill as US job grabber wouldn't help identify the cause of unemployment.

I have over five years IT experience with extensive exposure to a variety of Storage (SAN and NAS) Products and Six Sigma, ITIL / Problem and Program Management expertise to provide efficient IT Infrastructure Services. I was also trained in the US on EMC Storage products and handled data centers all over the world. I was also employed in Singapore and worked for UBS, the renowned Swiss Bank itself.
 
I moved to the US in 2013 as a new bride, to be with my husband. Being a highly skilled professional with a Master’s degree himself, he secured an H1 visa and we thought it was better for us to establish ourselves here in the US. However, I had to live here on the dependent H4 visa that clipped my wings – My independence, my own income, my ability to make contributions to my household and the country’s economy were all taken away - My education, skills and expertise are being wasted away without my willingness.  Severe depression swamps me due to being unable to work.
 
Having been lauded for my extremely unique and exceptional skill sets, experience and international exposure, I had several (at least 40 different) available opportunities come my way within the first 2 months of me moving to the US. But all the companies backed out of hiring me because I was on H4, and an H1 processing was not something they wanted to deal with given the expenses it incurs on the company. That said, I still found 2 companies who for the last 2 years were so keen to hire me that they went through all the trouble and expenses to file my H1, only for me to not make it in the H1 lottery for 2 CONSECUTIVE YEARS. The H1 lottery in itself is not a fair way of distribution of visas. It undermines talent to put it simply; not to forget the impact on the personal lives, personal economy and the country’s economy. Companies still show interest in me via LinkedIn, personal references and job search portals but back off due to my visa issues.
 
My husband and I have our life on hold given that we just have one earning member in the family. We do not have enough income to invest in a house, a second or even third new car, a further education / training and, children. Sadly, we tend to carefully monitor our vacation and luxury expenses. Our choices as a family are limited due to needing to justify every purchase. As an individual, I can't surprise my family with even a simple gift or trips or experiences as I do not have my own independent bank account, let alone earn my own money to put in it.
 
Had we had 2 jobs - which an employment authorization for me, a H4 holder will ensure, we will very soon be able to make those investments. Multiply this by the millions of H1/H4 holder families in the country - you will only see a tremendous and immediate spike in the economic growth and contributions to taxes.  EAD for H4 will also prevent several families from relocating to other countries that have better policies to retain and cultivate skilled talent
 
Also, the proposal allows for EAD only after the approved I-140 stage. While something is better than nothing, and we appreciate that at least this much being considered to be bestowed on thirsting souls like me, the I-140 approval stage itself is a long process and takes several years. This subjects H4 dependents to be out of the work force for those many years. Realistically, this is too long a wait. A more appreciable and favorable ruling would be to allow qualified and skilled H4 holders to be given employment authorization immediately with their visa’s without having to wait for their spouses I-140 approval. This is particularly important for young professionals.

"I strongly support the proposed rule for H4 spouses to be given Employment Authorization. I am one such H4 spouse. I am equally qualified as my spouse on H1B and losing out on all the opportunities, learning and growth in my career just because I dont have a work authorization.

I also feel that the existing rule for H4 dependants isnt fair, as most other employment visas such as L, E, and TN allow spouses to obtain a work authorization. The implementation of this proposed rule will make the H4 spouses eligible to compete in the market for a valid opportunity. This in turn will make mostly women (on H4) more independent, confident and help support the family financially. It also boosts the general morale of the individual when one can work and do justice to all the hardwork one has put in shaping their adacemics and career for over years and circumstances lead them to come over to the US and be an ""at home"" wife / spouse.

Overall, if the rule gets implemented, this will help us create better families, better communities in which H4 dependants also have been given equal rights for work permits.

The proposed rule is really good for qualified H4 visa holders. They will get an opportunity to work and contribute to the economy when their productivity and efficiency is at its peak and age is on their side. Denying them a chance to work can be counterproductive and will result in hardship on all fronts. Also their H1B spouses may be prompted to look for opportunities elsewhere in the world where the laws are kinder on the job front for dependent spouse.

"I’m writing to request you to pass the rule and grant Employment Authorization for Certain H-4 Dependent Spouses (of H1-B visa holders). I know that Democrats and Republicans are working on Immigration Reform, but much of the emphasis and focus seems to be on illegal immigrants. This specific rule is a small step towards reforming the legal immigration system, so people who are legally trying to immigrate to this country are not just an afterthought in this process. I have been here for 10 years and have an advanced engineering degree from an accredited US University and currently work for a Fortune 500 company on a H1-B visa. I have already begun the process of seeking permanent residency through employment (having an approved I-140), but by any estimate I would need at least another 10 or 15 years to even get permanent residency and many more for Citizenship. My wife who is here legally on a H4 dependent visa cannot work for any employer in the US despite having a Master's degree from an international University and currently working towards another Master's in Science degree in the US. She has been mostly at home all day wasting away her time and talent instead of working and contributing to the economy in whatever little way she can. This has also taken a toll on her self-confidence and emotional well being. 

We are hoping this will change in the near future, if and when this rule is passed. Through this rule, she can begin to look for employment opportunities and put her dual Masters degree to work and contribute to the economy. She will work for a US company, pay taxes and feel like a valued member of the community in a country she is going to live the rest of her life in. This rule adds only about 30,000 people (worst case scenario, though far from likely) to the job market, a very negligible addition to the US work force (less than 0.1% or so).

"This has been a very welcome and much needed push towards a more comprehensive and inclusive immigration overhaul. I have been in US for the last 6 years and now 2 yrs since approved for Permanent labor certification and I-140. Just because of my nationality we are made to wait for 7-8 yrs (after I-140 approval) to get the privilege of holding a permanent residency. It pains to see everyone around you get permanent residency and you still stuck in the same job, same employer for 7-8 years, just because you come from a country with huge population. There is a limit on the proportion of the year's allocation of any type of visa that can go to green card applicants from any one nation. I believe that this is in place to maintain the diversity of the country but a caveat is that there is no cap to the percentage of people who are coming into the country on different visas. Only a limit to those who get a green card. People are here, stay legally and pay their due share. The 7% cap is not doing anything to change the demographics or maintain diversity.  
We pay the same taxes, abide with the same rules, even pay for medicare and social security but are not eligible for its benefits. 
Its a privilege to stay in US and enjoy its benefits, but the present system is only holding people back to achieve their full potential and contribute to the progress of this great country. No one should forget that everyone living in US is an immigrant (except Native Americans), just that their forefathers came on a boat which sailed few centuries back. They have done tremendous hard work to get this country to its present state and given the opportunity the present group of immigrants will also contribute to their full potential. They need the support. No one is stealing anyone else's job.

I am writing to formally attest my support and request DHS assistance in passing this proposed rule. Rule allows or grants employment authorization for spouses of principal H-1B nonimmigrant with approved Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (Form I-140).  

Passing this rule would reduce economic hardship faced by my family as well as thousands of other families like mine and improve their quality of life. I came to the states in 2004 to pursue masters degree. I am currently on my 8th year of H1B visa (4 years since approved I-140) My wife currently holds an H4 visa. Both myself and my wife hold Masters degree in Business Administration from a reputed US University. She is currently unable to work since she utilized H1B visa for 1.5 years and its more than 6 years since she remained in that category. The decision to pursue family/children was the reason why she quit her job earlier. Now that my daughters have grown up a little, she would like to focus on her career but can't due to existing broken immigration regulations.    

As an economist, I strongly believe that, addition of workforce to any economy would also increase economy's overall size, generating greater fiscal benefits to all rather than only select few. This is because addition of extra income leads to more spending (someone else' income) more taxes, more social welfare for all. 

Per George Borjas, the nation's leading immigration economist estimates that the presence of immigrant workers makes the U.S. economy an estimated 11 percent larger ($1.6 trillion) each year. Passing this rule would allow some of these immigrants to work and contribute towards well-being of their families as well as growth and prosperity of the United States of America.

From competitiveness perspective majority of developed countries with employment based immigration system allow their spouses to work so making this change would put US at par with other such countries.  

Finally, Per Giovanni Peri “immigrants expand the U.S. economy’s productive capacity, stimulate investment, and promote specialization that in the long run boosts productivity,” 

Thus I am urging Department of Homeland Security to pass this rule without any further delays.

"Thank you for proposing this amendment to DHS regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(9)(iv) and 274a.12(c) to extend eligibility for employment authorization to H-4 dependent spouses of H-1B non-immigrants if the H-1B non-immigrants have either been granted status pursuant to sections 106(a) and (b) of AC21 or are the beneficiaries of an approved Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (Form I-140). I would like to highlight a few very important points that I think your agency considered before proposing this amendment, which makes this a well thought and much needed amendment:
1. This rule only applies to spouses of H-1B visa holders that either have their visas extended under AC21 or have obtained an approved Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (I-140). This in essences means that the only people who will benefit from this amendment have legally demonstrated their intent to migrate to the United States permanently.
2. Once this initial step is complete, the H-1B/H-4 visa holder has to wait for an immigrant visa number to become available before they can apply for adjustment of status to a permanent resident. For some countries, this wait can stretch over TEN years. 
3. During this excruciatingly long wait period the H-4 visa holder (spouse of H-1B visa holder) cannot seek employment. There are families I personally know, including myself, who either think of or actually do abandon their efforts of seeking permanent residency in the US. This is because they have a choice of moving to another developed nation that allows both the primary and dependent visa holders to work (such as Canada or Australia).
4. If a family does decides to abandon their efforts of seeking permanent residency due to employment constraints on H-4 visa holder during the long waiting period, the cost to the employer that invested significant time, money and effort in the immigration process is also immense. This is in addition to losing a valuable resource that they had groomed and trained over all these years.
5. In addition to the points mentioned above, an important thing to note is that this amendment will only bring the status of H-4 visa holders in line with other similar visa categories. These include dependent spouses of L, E-1 and E-2 visa holders that are allowed to seek gainful employment.",0,0,2014-07-08T00:00:00-04:00
"
I support this proposal one hundred percent.

This policy would help retain talent in US.Most H1B spouses are equally qualified and their spouses not being able to work would make most H1Bs go back to their home country.A lot  of these H1Bs are US advanced degree holders, US has invested a significant amount of resources on them ( Tuition waivers,scholarships,tax credits).

This would enable qualified H4s to work, contribute to economy and businesses to prosper creating more jobs.The numbers and insignificant compared to the total work force of US.

This would enable immigrant families to provide better for their kids who are US citizens and the future of United States.

This would curb activities of some unscrupulous visa agents and private visa mill universities, which are often desperate measures taken by H4 dependents.

This would free up a big share of H1B quota, which is crucial for US Advanced Degree holders who have risked thousands of dollars on their tuition, trusting the US system.This year (2014) at least 10,000 advanced degree holders could not continue on their jobs because of the H1B lot system. There was only 60% chance for a AD degree holder (40% for regular applicant) to get picked in the lottery.

This would make the immigration policy of US in line with other countries like Canada, Australia etc.

This is the right step taken by US in fixing broken immigration process which has always stood for Justice, fairness and gender equality (Vast majority of H4s are women)

company wants to send me again on an assignment which really needs my skills, but I am unable to take it up as my wife would need to quit her job for the second time and  join me on H4.

H-4 visa holders should NOT expect to take employment in the US - that was the condition that was in place when the visa was granted.
The current economic conditions in the US do NOT require the influx of this number of job seekers - any change in conditions allowing employment of H-4 visa holders should be based on NEED - not want. 
I can appreciate that the H-4 visa holders would want to work, but we do NOT want to hand off all the rights and privileges of US citizenship to foreign nationals.

"I support the proposed rule of employment authorization for Certain H4 dependent spouses. 
This is an ""OPPORTUNITY"" for thousands of H1B's who are staying alone in the US without their better half OR for those H4's (husbands/wives) who have left their Jobs in India and decide to stay with their better half. 
H1B is a ""non-immigrant"" temporary visa and the maximum time an H1B can work & stay in United States is 6 years provided he/she has a valid job (On payroll of a valid organization). Also this stay can be extended if their employer has filed for Green Card. 
So if an H1B can work, then why cant his/her better half who is equally or more skilled and educated be given an opportunity to work too?

Why is it so that L1 can apply for L2 EAD and stay and work in USA and both can contribute to USA's growing economy?
How different is a person on L1 from a person who is on H1B in terms of experience, skills and ability to speak,listen,write and read English. 
Likewise a person on L1 can work & stay for maximum 7 years but he can very well live with his family. End of the day they are one family staying together and the spouse can work too. 

But the spouse of someone on H1B, even if has Masters degree in Computer Science and continuous 8-10years of full time IT consultant experience, who has received certificates of excellence during his/her career, knows fluent English and can communicate effectively cannot work. 
So an H4 has to either stay separated for years or leave their current job (outside US) and join the spouse on H1 to at least stay together. 
H1B is again lottery, so how is it possible that even if the H4 has found a job in the USA can work ? He/she has to wait and wait and if luck is in their favor (not hard work) then there is a possibility of getting an approved H1B.

There are numerous jobs in the market for talented IT professionals. An H4 wouldn't be blindly granted job. Its obvious that they would need to prove themselves eligible for the job just like how an H1B has to. Then why not give them a CHANCE to work?
If the spouse has an approved I-140, it means that he has planned to stay for long in the states and contribute to USA's growing economy. Why should his/her spouse who is educated and experienced (e.g. IT professional) be at home? What about their career? Only because the H4 chose to stay together with the H1B spouse as a family, they cannot work? Why?


I am on a valid H1B visa here in states and have been working for more than a year now. But my husband cannot work because H4 doesn't allow him to work. We have stayed apart for months now, and he could only come down and meet me whenever he gets time off. We both want to continue staying in USA, but my husband who is on H4 cannot work. How long can my husband be sitting at home without doing any work? He has Bachelors in Engineering degree, more than 9 years of experience in IT industry, excellent communication skills in English but is short of a visa in USA to work.

Countries like Canada, have open work permit and allows both husband and wife to work. They do have rules and regulations. Only after all the eligibility criteria are met and there is valid employment offer, an IT professional can work. The best part is they allow the spouse to work too and in that way they don't need to stay parted away from each other.

"America is known as the land of opportunities but when it comes to H4 visa holders this has not been the case for ages. Unfortunately , even highly skilled Spouses who travel to America on H4 visa become financially dependent and loose the opportunity to grow in their career once they are here. Around 75 % of these are women and many of them are highly educated. As a H4 visa holder myself , I would like to share my thoughts on some of the concerns raised against this rule on this forum.

1) The rule only permits certain H4 visa holders to obtain work authorization. To correct the wrong notion, these are not 'ILLEGAL immigrants' . The eligibile candidates are legally staying in America and paying their taxes in US for more than 6 years and are awaiting their citizenship . For candidates from certain countries , this process takes 15 years or more on an average and hence these H4 visa holders even though capable, are unable to work for a long period causing a huge break in their career and even more difficult to resume work after they become citizens. Yes, they could try to get a H1 just like their spouse but with the current lottery system , the H1 process is just pure luck than the measure of real talent. America is a land of immigrants and these future citizens could start contributing to the country's growth much earlier . 

2) One other concern is ..these H4 candidates would get jobs faster than American citizens due to minimum wages . Allowing H4 visa holders to work does not mean we are promoting outsourcing. These candidates are already living in America and hence they will be out in the market looking for jobs which they would qualify and be paid equally as others in the same field. They are NOT outsourced resources that would be hired faster due to minimum wages .

3) Another major concern is that providing work authorization to 100,000 H4 visa holders will be a threat to American Jobs. First of all , each of the 100,000 H4 visa holders would not be looking for jobs in America. At the very max , may be 50 %  or even lesser may be qualified and may want to work actively.  Second of all, obtaining EAD does not mean they will get jobs. Every company has a strict process to hire and the individuals who apply for the job would have to prove their skills and be able to clear these interviews in competition with the fellow Americans. As mentioned in the above point, they would be applicants trying for the same wages and hence there is no reason for the companies to be biased towards these individuals other than the talent if proved better.  Only if they are able to stand out against the competing Americans they will get work . There may be an increased competition for IT and software companies but Americans who are working or have worked in these areas are very smart enough to withstand this competition. There would be hardly or very minimal increase in competition for other areas than technology.

4) The other concern was that this rule will increase unemployment for American citizens in America. As mentioned in the above two points, only the highly competent H4 visa holders would get jobs as they would still have to survive the hiring process . Once the companies hire the highly skilled and competent resources here in America (be it a citizen or H4 visa holder) it will ultimately help improve the American economy which in turn would generate more and more jobs within the country as opposed to outsourcing . And more job opportunities within the country would rather help improve the employment rate .
Promoting this rule would also show an increase in real estate investments due to improved economic growth in the country and financial stability for the future american citizens. 

All in all, I support this rule and request all who have concerns to re-evaluate your thoughts and help in making the country a better place . ",0,0,2014-05-22T00:00:00-04:00

I’ve noticed that most of the comments in favor of this ruling seem to come from H1B Visa holders.   This would make sense, as it would help improve their life.  However, they are guests; they have no voting privileges, and should not have them.

"H4 spouses were waiting for this rule for long. Generally the spouses of H-1B visa holder gets EAD once they reach at the final stage of Green Card processing. Because of the long backlog only the citizens of a very few countries are not getting the opportunity. In most of the cases these families are here in United States for more than 6-8 years. They are paying taxes, buying houses, raising their kids here. Their spouses are highly qualified or even have prior job experience. The only option for these H-1B spouses to get a work permit here in US is to find a sponsor for H1-B visa. The H-1B selection process became lottery based in recent past because of the high demand and now it is extremely difficult even for a well qualified H-1B spouse to get a job here. This rule will definitely help these H-1B spouses and their families. ",0,0,2014-06-03T00:00:00-04:00

"This is a very good proposal and should be implemented soon. (1) The proposal makes USA to continue to be a land of equal opportunity irrespective of gender. Since majority of H4 spouses on H1B holders are women, it provides a way for women to pursue their career goals without being completely dependent on their H1B spouses. (2) The proposal provides real value and motivation for highly skilled H1B holders to remain in USA instead of going back to their home country and apply the skills they learned in USA.",0,0,2014-05-21T00:00:00-04:00
"This change in regulations is limited to certain H-4 dependent spouses of principal H-1B nonimmigrants who have begun the process of seeking lawful permanent resident status through employment. However, it takes time until H-4 dependent spouses are eligible, and they are forced in the meantime to put their career on hold. Many of such H-4 dependent spouses are highly-skilled workers that in most cases were advancing their careers in their home countries and have to face a great constraint to continue doing so as they relocate their families to the US. If the DHS really wants to encourage professionals with high demand skills to remain in the country and help spur the innovation and growth of US companies, it should broaden its perspective and offer real solutions to this important issue. The problem arises since the very first day spouses arrive in the US. Additionally, spouses of other type of non-immigrant visa holders such as E, L and J are entitled to work authorization. H-4 dependent spouses should have this opportunity as well. ",0,0,2014-05-15T00:00:00-04:00

It helps the economy by paying taxes, creating jobs, there are lots of enterpreneurs hiding just because of the H4 visa and they are unable to use their talents because of the visa restrictions. Appreciate if you approve this and make it as a law. Its not going to affect any of the existing american's job because these are the people who are waiting to become American citizens so its safe to approve this.",0,0,2014-07-14T00:00:00-04:00

"1) First H4 dependents are not restricted to apply H1B visa, they can always apply for H1B if they have eligibility and have 
    experience in related field. If they were on H4 for 6 years obviously they were not working all the 6 years and that clearly
    shows they are not competitive enough to get the H1B. Most competitive H4 spouses got into H1B the moment they 
    came from abroad.
2) USA never restricted H4 spouses. If they are competitive enough they can get into the F1 student visa, then they can 
    get internship then they can get through regular H1B process within 2 years. There is always option. Still they are Idle 
     for 6 years, how America can consider them as talented high skilled H4 spouses who are competitive enough.
3) This New Proposal shows that those spouses who are in more than 6 years are eligible to work. 
     That clearly means that H4 spouses are idle at home and they can not get through in the H1B visa
4) How this New Proposal would bring competitive environment in US where the spouses who are idle for almost 6 years, 
    and they could not get into the regular H1B. This clearly shows that those who are remaining in H4 and Idle for 6 years 
    are not competitive or they don't have the required skill set or they don't have the experience
5) Once this New Proposal would become law, H4 spouses may try to get some experience letters from India or China or 
    other countries and the job market flooded with fake resumes then ended up in lowering the wages for Americans
6) If those spouse were skilled and qualified enough then they would have got H-1B by now.....
    But now they will get EAD and will get a low rate assignment with the help of a consultant or vendor and will
   reduce the overall salary rates in the high skilled competitive phase
7) This will bring the USA competitiveness to the different angle. For US citizens rather than fighting with high skilled 
    efficient talented worker, Americans would end up in fighting with lower wages spouses
8) But for struggling Americans, it will only reduce wages, lower job opportunities, and make it harder for them in the high 
    skilled phase
9) From 2000 to 2014 we know how much the salary got reduced for Americans in the high skilled market because of the 
    lower wages workers from abroad. How many jobs shipped to offshore.
10) Compare the 2 companies. 
      a) IBM services business revenue during 2000, it was $33 Billion. The same period Tata Consultancy services (TCS)
          revenue was just $700 million
      b) Now IBM (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Global_Services) revenue is $58 Billion (It is not even double compare to
          2000 revenue). Now if you refer the TCS (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Consultancy_Services) revenue is at 
          $13.5 billion. It almost grown 15 times.
     c) Ultimately foreign companies benefited more
11) Salary Comparison
      a) We should not compare the year 2000 mainframe salary with now, then people claim mainframe is outdated
      b) So compare the SAP or Oracle technology salary between 2000 and 2014
      c) In 2000 average hourly rate was $150, now in 2014 average hourly rate is $75. Almost half. 
      d) Again foreign companies have the concept of blended rate they average out the salary for US and Offshore
          resources
      e) Foreign companies will end up in giving job to H4 low wage salary as they were idle for 6 years and the show can be
          managed entirely from Offshore.
      f) Americans who is looking for competitive environment and competitive salary will end up in loosing job
12) This Proposed Rule is intended to bring good life style for foreign spouses, but that result in more talented competitive  
      high skilled Americans loosing their job because of lower wages and loosing their good life style in the competitive 
     and high skilled market.",0,0,2014-05-15T00:00:00-04:00

It has been 6years since I came here after our marriage.
I applied for H1B two times through lottery and my luck didnt work.This one is my last hope.

I am a postgraduate in computer applications and worked in India for 3 years.
My marriage was in 2008,came here with a hope of either I could apply for H1B or will get Green Card(GC).

 1)If  I talk about me I have masters degree but not getting opportunity to serve the community due to my visa status. Like me there r several other H4 visa holders who poses specialized knowledge and if American economy can use these talent which is already present here then they will definitely can save money in bringing this talent from outside will also help reducing unemployment.
2) Also if two heads are working in home definitely spending power will increase and which will result in to more investments and spending in United States  like buying more houses,etc which will ultimately increase the money circulation in the economy , can give boost to certain industries n businesses like real estate industry, mortgage companies etc and at the same time will help reducing the unemployment .
3) last but not least but where L2 visa holder gets EAD why not H 4 . If we see past records and data more h1b visa holders n there spouses applied for citizenship process and stayed in USA then L1/L2 visa status people where as L1/L2 people moves back to their home country after there tenure is over. This is outflow of currency.

"This one rule can definitely change our lives & many other families that I know.

We are a family of 3, me, my wife and a daughter. I came here on a H1B many years ago and like many immigrant aspirants, I having been awaiting my turn in the green card queue. Back then it was a reasonable wait to get your green card, but not so anymore. Looking at the current wait period we, like many others, may have to wait 7-8 years at least before we can get there.

Which also means my wife, who is an educated professional & had a very successful and a growing career before coming to US with me after our marriage on a H4 visa, cannot work or get a job for that many years. Her professional achievements can just be measured from the fact that, in a part-time school that she attended here in the US after coming on H4 she has a 4.0 GPA.

This rule will certainly help individuals on H4 and their families but more so will help greatly boost the US economy numerous way,
 - Adding highly qualified and professionally trained resource base will sprout new products & assist existing businesses to grow beyond current realms all of which in-turn will contribute to country's overall growth and its GDP.
 - It will help captivate the ever increasing need for professional talent in the country, especially in the IT/Tech industry, without having to increase current H1 limits.
 - With that much more workforce in offices, it would bring additional tax revenue to the country which can in turn help lower the current debt.
 - Finally, more income per household should encourage more spend which will add to the country's indirect tax (sales tax) revenue & would also add a little spin to the slowing US economy.

This is a very welcome change and we'll be eagerly waiting for this rule to be implemented.

As an employer and owner of an IT solutions business, I have seen the challenges of hiring H1B visa holders. I have undertaken numerous efforts to hire or train US Citizens or Permanent Residents, but being a small business makes it tough to attract such talent and all efforts so far have resulted in very low response, if at all any. 

For the people who complain about unemployment rate being so high, I think its not wise to connect that with skilled immigrants. Try posting an ad for skilled resource and you will get no response vs an ad for office admin gets lot of resumes. I think the real issue is BPO or oursourcing. Those are the jobs that we need to bring back. I have seen the advantage of hiring someone local vs offshore. The reason businesses are going offshore because they can't find the talent here, jobs stay open for too long and we need to change this perception.

"Hi,

I strongly believe that US government will be taking the another step towards the right direction with this rule.
These are my reasons
1) For family coming from India getting a green card takes around 6 years. In most of the cases for this 6 years H4 holder will be sitting ideal at home because of the problems they face in finding a job without a work visa
2) Employers are, almost always, very reluctant to sponsor H1B visa. 
3) H1B holder and family have already shown their eagerness to be part of USA by applying for permanent residence status. Having a job before helps the H4 holder to be a productive and contributing part of the society by the time their permanent residency request is approved.
4) Since H4 visa holder is integrating into the society before their permanent residency request approval, society also gets a chance to gauge how good H4 visa holder is.
5) A very large percentage, and I estimate that to be more than 80%, of the spouses have at least Bachelor's degree. Many have Masters or PHD level degree in their field of expertise. USA society and economy has a lot to benefit by making right use of this unused brain power. 
6) One of earning member means more financial stability. This makes the family feel safe and comfortable. Since family is the foundation of society, this means society becomes better.  
7) One of earning member means more money to invest. Buying a home and settling down is the dream of any immigrant family. So once family has financial stability and certainty, they will be ready to invest in homes and schools, which is good for economy and society.

"In response to Comment Submitted by Sharon D. Silva.

Currently according to statistical data on immigrant visa issued in fiscal year 2013 in travel.state.gov website, 205,435 are given to immediate relatives, 6,424 for special immigrants,189,020 for family preference, 21,144 for employment based, and 51,080 for diversity immigrants [4]. So a total of 451,959 enter the labor force each year from other categories other than H4 EAD.

It has nothing to do with H4 EAD. Think about the broader EAD that is given to family based immigrant visa,immideate relatives, special immigrant visa I and others which is around 451,959  EAD's every year which enters the labor market. It is more to do with consulting companies. The fake resumes that you mentioned is a more generic term. Each and every candidate in US have to go various round of interviews to prove his/her skillset to qualify for job.  If there is one or two cases, it does not mean all H4 EADs are in same boat. The H4 EAD only gives an option to work. It does not gauarantee or provide a job. Also if a person is idle for some years. He/she can sharpen her skills and may qualify for the job. Job break in their careers does not mean they are not talented or qualified.

Please do not give EADs to anyone with an Approved I-140. This is rather broad, and will include people who barely was on H-1b with a Labor certification and I-140 Premium approval and their dependents get a Blanket EAD. This is obviously not the intention of the proposal. The intention is to give EADs to those People who have been here for a long time, and have been waiting for their immigrant visa number after spending a considerable amount of time on H-1b. Not anyone with just an approved I-140. In fact, I am afraid, this will spawn fraudulent cases for EAD specifically from India and you are just gving EADs  to a huge number of people. Please restrict the amount given and please give it only to people who have been waiting for a long time.

EADs to dependents of holders:
- Who have spent 6 years or more on H-1b and have extended their H-1b based on AC-21, and an approved I-140.

This is a reasonable change, which will put a reasonable, upper limit on the number of EADs, and not affect the local unemployment conditions, with citizens struggling to find jobs and make ends meet, including minorities and students,
As this EAD is open to a job in any field, you have to really consider the consequences, and just limit the number of people eligible for it.

This is definitely an opportunity for H4 visa holders to contribute to their local communities that they have been a part of for so many years and also grow in their career. This is a very sensible move. It will help highly skilled spouses of EB2/EB3 employees to practice their skills and thereby add more value to the society,0,0,2014-06-23T00:00:00-04:00
I strongly oppose this Rule. I do support the initiative to allow spouses of H1-B workers to work but this rule would have no labor protection for the jobs these H4 holders would acquire. Why not propose a separate CAP exempt visa to the H4 holders so that the job positions they take up require labor certification ensuring that they are offered fair wages and that no qualified American workers are surpassed for these jobs. The H1-B workers are subjected to these requirements so should their spouses. This seems to be an easy way out for those on H4 who are unwilling to make an effort to obtain an H1B visa to procure any job (beneath or outside of their skills) exposing them to abuse by employers and creating an enormous job glut that will invariably lead to falling wages. ,0,0,2014-06-10T00:00:00-04:00

1) This will bring down the already low wages being paid for H1B employees as a lot of dependents on H4 will be ready to work for low wages since they are not the primary source of income in the family.

2) Everyone coming from India have a bachelor's degree. That doesn't mean they are all highly skilled labor. This is due to the fact that countless colleges open up every year in India that offer these degrees.

"Hello,

I applaud this proposal by USCIS as this has been much needed regulation for non-immigrants who come here and their spouse are unable to work due to the restriction on H-4 visa. H1B workers are a pillar of America's high-tech economy, heavily relied on to bridge the gap between the short supply and high demand for top-flight technical talent. This is going to help H1-b household and will help improve American economy in a number of ways. 

First and foremost it will provide much needed talent in the fields of STEM to small and large corporations. 
Secondly, with dual income non-immigrant who are waiting for Permanent Residence can comfortably spend more and also think about buying big ticket items like home purchase, new car etc. helping American economy by the rising consumer spending in this group. Further more there have been number of studies that suggest that over time bringing high skilled workers will create more jobs for American economy. 
Third, It will add to the tax revenue generated from H-4 employment. Some of them from STEM field tend to make more than the national average salary adding more to the tax revenue generated through immigrants. 

There are some immigrants who would like to open businesses and employ american workers for their businesses once they achieve their Green card status but providing dual income can help make that plan a reality.

I have a Master’s degree in Computer Science and graduated in 2010. I work at a Fortune 500 company. I am also pursuing part-time MBA to further my knowledge, skills and advance my career.

My wife, on the other hand, finished her Master’s degree in Healthcare Administration in 2011. Due to some personal reason, she had to finish her graduate studies and leave for her home country. She couldn't re-enter U.S.A. on her student visa since she had completed her studies. We were blessed with baby boy in Mar. 2012, in our home country.

My wife and son applied for dependent visa in 2012. The visa (H4) was granted and they were back in U.S.A. in Sep. 2012. My wife, all these years has been a homemaker, without a job. She is ready to join the workforce, but because of her dependent status, she can't. 

I would like to point out again that my wife has a graduate degree in Healthcare, granted by a US institution. She also had the skills and experiences that are desired in this society. She can contribute to the society, by joining the workforce and by contributing taxes. With more income, we could become a first generation home-owner. 

If I may, I would suggest granting an immediate employment authorization, rather than waiting for approved I-140, to spouses who have pursued degree from US institutions and who are on dependent status.

I applaud the initiative, taken by DHS in considering the quandary that skilled H1B holders and their dependent face.

1. I am holding of making the 2nd child because my spouse doesn't have the job giving the necessary salary based upon her skillset. 

2. The reason why employer doesn't give enough salary because they gave the reason of Expenses occurring for sponsoring H1-B visa for H-4 candidates and talking about risks involved. The legal and sponsorship expenses are @ $3000 to $4000 but employer while offering the salary for H4 candidate for new H1-B sponsorship is lower by almost $10K-20K per year less than what an EAD candidate will get.

3. Even though somehow H4 Spouses get  H1-B sponsorship sometimes due to family reasons they have to take break from the job by coming back on H4 status and stay home and resume the job once the family priorities are met. Its always tough to get back new H1-B sponsorship, NO MATTER how good skillset you have for the job.

4. Spouse having good skillset which help American companies to get to the next level of their technology always struggles getting into the start up companies to contribute because almost all startups don't have a capital to sponsor H1-B and they don't want to go through messed up Immigration Systems sometimes. 

5. You make the life easier for H4 people to secure them jobs where their skillset matches, they start living a better life and contribute to US Economy. If my spouse would have had EAD by now I would have had a second child which would have been going to some day care or use a nanny service giving other people for an opportunity to earn the job as well.

Since this is not possible now because of employer-employee relation, it is harder for H4 spouses. Thats why so much noise is being created and the Govt has reacted by enforcing this proposed rule. If people are so talented, they should be ready to go to school and get that hard earned H1b visa. 100000 H4 spouses multiplied by 40000$ is about 4 billion dollars revenue for educational institutes. Not many spouses were ready to spend that money/already had masters/directly wanted to work. These are the H4s complaining. If this rule is proposed, there wont be any applications for F1 by international students/H4 to F1 by really talented spouses of H1bs. People will only try to get H1bs.

But EAD for H4 visa holders voids this practice and thereby creating unemployment due to flood of excessive labor with proper investigation of the labor market. 

2. Getting I-140 approved is quite an easy process. Granting EAD is almost same as doubling H1B quota. You should add further requirements such minimum 3 years on H1B or something to control the queue. Remember US economy is just recovering.

I, myself, fall in the said category (H4 Visa) and have a Master's degree from a highly recognized university in the United States, which is obsolete to me due to the work restrictions imposed on me by the dependent visa category. I believe that by the introduction of this legislation, a high-skilled and educated spouse of a H1-B visa holder can equally contribute to not only the financial burden of the family as they await the transition from a non-immigrant status to that of a lawful permanent resident, but to the overall American economy by boosting the population of educated, skilled workers in the country's workforce that contribute to the overall success and profitability of the various public and private sectors that would be willing to employ them with the availability of the Employment Authorization. Without the employment authorization, I am left to either waste away a perfectly good education or apply for a H-1B visa myself. If a majority of the given percentage of skilled and educated H-4 visa holders (a high percentage, from personal interactions with other H-4 visa holders), tried and succeeded to obtain a H-1B visa, this would potentially drastically reduce the number of H-1B visas available to other potential high-skilled workers which could have otherwise been allotted to them. Additionally, as the rule itself proposes, the employment authorization for H-4 spouses will serve to act as a highly attractive incentive for additional foreign skilled workers to consider a permanent residency in the United States. With the current work-related restrictions on H-4 visa holders, the chances of such an individual obtaining employment using illegal or unauthorized means are multifold which is an unwanted and an unfortunate circumstance, and one that can be completely eliminated with the availability of this authorization.

How would I be notified in advance once he/she is in out of status due to above reason?

US should answer how can a person with such a mental setback lead a happy life?

There are people in US who say this is a threat to no. of jobs available to US citizens. In my view private employers hire people who clear interviews and are right fit. They will keep the position open but will not hire under qualified people. So the question to US folks who think this is threat is are you trying hard to get a job, if you are well qualified then no one is stopping you from getting a job. Changing H4 rules doesn't hamper you chances, but does a social good to women. And even if you feel these women can increase some competition in job hunting then its a healthy competition.

"This rule is a first step in the right direction. I would suggest that work authorization be extended to all H-1B dependents (H-4 status holders), instead of a subset of spouses in H-4 status; and it be made incident to status.

Depending upon when the employer chooses to start the process, the labor certification (PERM) and I-140 approval usually takes a few years and the non-availability of work authorization during this time frame forces a break in the career of a H-4 status holder (unless they change to a work authorized status). The benefit of providing immediate work authorization to all H-1B dependents is that it would minimize this break to the (H-4) spouse's professional career, thereby reducing the adverse impact of even a temporary relocation to US. Inherently it makes US more attractive by enticing H-1B status holders (or potential H-1B beneficiaries) to consider working in the US, both, long-term and short-term, not only for themselves but for their spouses as well. While H-1B is usually valid up to six years, the financial security from having two working spouses would incentivize H-1B status holders to stay in the US longer by considering LPR status. The potential benefit to the employer of the H-1B principal is that the H-1B principal is likely to stay in their employ longer.

The regulation should be implemented by making the work authorization 'incident to status' as is done for work authorized visas. The paperwork reductions from this type of implementation are enormous. It would also save H-4 dependents, both, time and money because they would no longer need to formally apply for work authorization or any extensions thereof. Nor would their employers have to worry about annotating the I-9 forms everytime a new EAD is obtained. Perhaps, the implementation might be as simple as tweaking the E-Verify system but no one-time major or recurring costs would occur to USCIS. (The current regulations has USCIS processing numerous I-765 forms.)

Now the only concern would be that this change would extend work authorization to children of H-1B status holders, which goes beyond the original intent of the regulation; but this would not be a major issue. In order to be considered dependents, the children of H-1B status holders would have to be below a certain (presumably 18 or 21 years) age and generally at this age the children would either be in high school or in college. So even though the benefit of work authorization is available to the H-1B dependent children, the number of such children availing of this benefit is likely to be minimal.

Thus by expanding the pool of beneficiaries, this regulation would still continue targeting spouses in H-4 status, without the unintended effect of excessive participation from other H-4 (non-spouse) dependents. In addition, the above changes would also make the US attractive also to those H-1B principals who have relocated temporarily (i.e., for a period up to six years) to US by providing immediate career options to their spouses. The benefit to the US economy is that it would retain highly-skilled workers longer by providing career options to all H-1B spouses.",0,0,2014-05-16T00:00:00-04:00
"Hi I am MBA in IT and BSc (computer science) Having 7 years of IT experience. it includes working for most prestigious clients  like AT&T and Microsoft.I came here in 2013 on h4 visa with calculated risk of applying h1 and resume working.Alas it was not picked in lottery.Again tried this year and hate to be driven by chance.I left my hard earned job and not using extremely hard earned qualification because I took a risk and my fate was not in favor.
I think this step is too much welcoming to allow h4 for EAD it will make them useful and contributing directly in US economy.They anyways are using local resources benefitted by US policies so why not make them. Actually useful.But I think policy should be open for all H4 .I know its big WHY????Two arguments I have for this :

1.The filter you are applying as per rule is subset of dependents who have spent here significant time waiting anything similar to happen.People who just reached here having hot skill set having hands on have to wait years to get into that filter and might loose the edge.Will it not be better if people with fresh degrees and current skill set start contributing immediately.
2.lets take a scenario in case if I want to work and my H1 Doesn't happen. I don't intend to stay here forever but just to get my working status done we might think of applying I-140.Because we aren't left with any other option.

I highly support the proposed rule to be approved in the near future as many families with H1B visa are struggling economically and spiritually due to single income and the stay-home H4 could be in a panic status for many years as the right to work is deprived. Many families are considering moving to other countries that are more receptive to their education and precious experience.,0,0,2014-05-22T00:00:00-04:00
"I strongly support this rule be passed ASAP. This really helps several individuals who are at the mercy of their green card priority date becoming current some day in order to be able to even hope to apply for a job. At which point, they have already lost a considerable period of their life in which they could have helped to contribute positively to this economy.

In addition to this, I highly recommend that the DHS prioritizes/considers giving EADs to H4 spouses with advanced degrees from US institutions. This will help America to retain highly skilled individuals, trained here in the US institutions.

I can completely understand the stress and loss of self-confidence for the H4 individuals who have to just sit at home and do nothing with their life in spite of being very well qualified to apply and get professional jobs and eventually make a difference to American economy. 

It is sad how certain individuals with minimum knowledge of immigration system misinterpret this for granting work authorization to illegal immigrants. H4 is very much a legal immigration status. This rule does not allow free jobs for all H4s. It only allows EADs to certain individuals who are already through up to a certain stage in the green card process, who would eventually get their EAD and green card anyway, it is only a matter of not losing their valuable years of their life waiting for the priority date to become current. Additionally, EAD does not guarantee a job. It only makes individuals eligible for applying for a job. This should actually be a fundamental right of every individual regardless of the country/region that they are in.

"Yes, It is a welcoming change.  I have been here in U.S. legally for the past 11 years with my wife and two children and my EB3 Greencard is no where in the near future which was filed in 2008.  Managing the house with just single income is really getting hard for me especially, with grown up kids.  My son will be going to college this fall and my daughter in couple of years. Since we are on H1B, we are not qualified for any kind of student loans or federal support, I had to completely support him.  Had my wife had work permit, it could have been easy to support my sons college tution.

Another point is, since my wife does not work and she does not have any financial freedom, we are having constant arguments over money, recently we also went up to divorce discussion and ended up in counselling currently. 

Lastly, why this rule is limited to 'Spouses'?  My son, even though he is going to college, he is not eligible to work (part time either) because he is on H4.  For him to work, he should be on F1 visa.  If I get him F1 Visa, he will be treated as Interfnational student and he will loose the 'in-state' status for  college tution which is more than double and I am no way can afford.

"The rule is proposed to retain high skilled workers who are in the path of becoming lawful permanent resident and naturalized citizens of this country. These group of individuals have directly contributed to America’s economic growth for decades. There are studies and papers which have proven this claim (eg: http://www.kauffman.org/what-we-do/research/immigration-and-the-american-economy) . They create jobs and not steal jobs from citizens. Skill and Qualifications bring them to the US, but they are men and women who build their lives in the US, pay taxes, buy houses and have kids. H4 spouses could be highly qualified as H1 principal or not, but the restriction to not have liberty to work is restraining and demeaning. It takes away self-identity of these spouses. Expecting H1B high skilled workers to keep contributing at the helm of their ability while their spouses are treated with indignity and negligence is unfortunate to say the least. 

H4 spouses who possess skills for a specialized job are not even considered for evaluation because of their visa status. It’s a fact that companies decline visa transfer process from H4 to H1 due to various reasons (quota, wait times for work eligibility, uncertainty of the H1 lottery etc.) I was looking at some arguments against this rule stating Fraud as a concern (mainly around fake resumes). I think such statements are not only disrespectful to the families who are legally going through the process of seeking lawful permanent residency but also raises questions on US firm’s ability to choose an eligible candidate for a particular job. I think with respect to this rule such concerns are baseless. 
Please add text in the rule specifying the rules around EAD validity times and conditions (like whether validity should be tied to Principal’s H1 validity etc). I think these should be aligned to existing L2 EAD rules.  

This rule shows USCIS under its current leadership is progressive and appreciates the necessity of treating law abiding high skilled residents and their families with respect. Its a very positive proposal and will go miles in terms of boosting the US economy.",0,0,2014-05-20T00:00:00-04:00
"H-4 visa holders should be provided work permit. Having H4 holder not being able to work is a huge injustice to these women who have a lot of potential and skills to add to the US economy. 

H1B holders have a legal status in the country and pay all taxes to the US govt - they part of the system. Given H1B holder comply with all the rules and have legal status and pay taxes, having their wives stamped with H4 non-workable visa is not justifiable. If H1B are required to pay taxes and are fully eligible by law to live in this country and contribute to the economy, H4 SHOULD BE ALLOWED legally to work. ",0,0,2014-05-15T00:00:00-04:00
"Some definitions for people who just do not seem to understand English. The proposed rule is very clear if one can read and understand basic sentences in English. 

H-1B visa - The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa in the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act, section 101(a)(15)(H). It allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations LEGALLY. 

Duration of stay:

The duration of stay is three years, extendable to six years. An exception to maximum length of stay applies in certain circumstances:

    - If a visa holder has submitted an I-140 immigrant petition or a labor certification prior to their fifth year anniversary of having the H-1B visa, they are entitled to renew their H-1B visa in one-year or three-year increments until a decision has been rendered on their application for permanent residence.
    - If the visa holder has an approved I-140 immigrant petition, but is unable to initiate the final step of the green card process due to their priority date not being current, they may be entitled to a three-year extension of their H-1B visa. This exception originated with the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000.

Even though the H-1B visa is a LEGAL non-immigrant visa, it is one of the few visa categories recognized as dual intent, meaning an H-1B holder can have legal immigration intent (apply for and obtain the green card) while still a holder of the visa. In the past the employment-based green card process used to take only a few years, less than the duration of the H-1B visa itself. However, in recent times the legal employment-based immigration process has backlogged and retrogressed to the extent that it now takes many years for guest-work visa holders from certain countries to obtain green cards. Since the duration of the H-1B visa hasn't changed, this has meant that many more H-1B visa holders must renew their visas in one or three-year increments for continued legal status while their green card application is in process.

H4 visa - An H-4 visa is a LEGALLY issued visa by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to immediate family members (spouse and children under 21 years of age) of the H-1B visa holders. An H4 visa holder is not eligible to work or get a Social Security number (SSN).[9] An H4 Visa holder may attend school, get a driver's license, and open a bank account in the U.S. To claim a dependent on a tax return or file a joint tax return, the dependent must obtain an Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN), which is only used for tax filing purposes.

H-1B visa workers pay all the taxes (federal, state, medicare, social security and property etc.) just like any other working American. In majority of cases, the H-1B workers are in the 25% to 28% federal income tax bracket. It is a significant contribution to the country. 

Now, for the people who do not understand the meaning of the word ""amnesty"", which by the way is nowhere mentioned in this proposed rule simply because it DOES NOT apply to H4 or H-1B workers,   

Amnesty - It is a decision that a group of people will not be punished or that a group of prisoners will be allowed to go free.

H-1B workers and their spouses are not illegal immigrants or political prisoners to be given amnesty.

"I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS RULE:

This rule is not affecting all H1b workers, only who are in the process of getting a status of permanent residency. 
Usually it takes 3+ years to reach this stage (I140 approval) and after that depending on the backlog several more years to get the status of status of permanent residents  mentioned in the rules, this proposal is simply accelerating the time frame for when these H-4 dependent spouses would be eligible to enter the labor market, because they would become eligible for employment authorization when an immigrant visa number becomes available to the H-1B principal and the H-1B dependent spouse 
files an application for adjustment of status. 

There is no opening of floodgate, lowering of wages etc. as many would like to point out.. The impact of this change is very minimal on the US labor market and if anything, I see this as a right step towards building a better talent tool for future of this country. 

As for the shortage of high skilled workers there are several studies/surveys completed in recent years that show that there is a shortage of workers for certain professions. While I agree that US should increase its effort on education, to remain competitive  in the short term the issue of shortage of high skilled workers need to be addressed.

http://stewartcoopercoon.com/blog/shrm-projects-a-decline-in-skilled-workforce-job-retention/ 

As a personal note I have worked in several Global Automotive companies in their R&D divisions for 8 years and have seen firsthand the shoratge of employees with highly specialized skill sets. 
In such a scenario, when the job is offered to a person holding a H1b visa, the wages are not lowered. 
Also, there are minimum wage limits for the employers to sponsor a greencard and these are quite high. This rule affects only those subset of H1b visa holders. 

The result of doing nothing by the US could be: 
1. US losing its competitive advantage in the world. 
2. Companies cannot find a good fit will try to shift more work to regions where those skills are readily available. This will mean that not only these jobs are lost, they will not come back to US even in future. 

Most people who will benefit from this rule have been in US for more than 6 years working (contributing to the economy). 
However for them it takes 10 plus years to get a work authorization for their spouse who in most cases are highly qualified. 

Compared to this long wait time, people in family based greencard, diversity greencard, lottery system can (and do) come to this country in far larger number, can work in much earlier and there is no specific set of requirements for them to work in US. 
I see that people with advanced degrees and specialized skill sets have to suffer for years even though they have been doing everything a good citizen of this country will do for years without getting similar rights are the much bigger fraction of non employment based immigration.

In reality, with high cost of living, it is not enough for a household of three to have only one person working.  It is really tough.  It is causing financial difficulties, emotional and mental stress for the family of the H4 visa holder.  As much as possible we do not want to be a burden to the government.

I truly beleive that DHS Docket No. USCIS-2010-0017 must be approved and implemented since many H1B workers who moved to USA with their family will need a second source of income to support family expenses specially for families who have kids going to College. Secondly, the Change of status from H1B to permanent residency (Green Card) takes years to be approved and H1B supported family have a lot of difficulty coping with basic needs for years until the spouse is legal to work.

And most important, may H1B spouses are also Degree holders and with ample experience in their field of profession. Thier experience and knowledge are not being used for a long time since they cannot work. That is a talent wasted.

"It important to read and understand the proposed rule. I read few negative comments who are opposition based on wrong understanding. This process DOES NOT give EAD to all H4 dependents. 

Proposed Rule only provides EAD for spouses dependents if the original H1 has started green card process and is at certain stage (I-140 or AC21). The H1 holders those are at this stage have made up their mind to settle in US. After few years, they are going to be US citizens. So we talking about the future citizens only. 

I have been in US for more than 8 years. This option will provide my spouse ability to work on EAD. Because of green card back log, it may take me another few years to get green card. Without this, my spouse's only option is to apply for separate H1 visa and start separate green card process. With H1 lottery, we are not sure whether she will get H1 or not. At the moment, she is working on OPT. But what will happen after OPT we do not know if this rule does not pass. Because of H1 lotter, we are not sure whether she will get to work or not. She is Phd holder and completed research in Medicinal science. She has been developing medicine for critical dieases. 

We are also expecting our baby and she will not able to take a long break without this option. Because we can not afford her to lose OPT status. In summary, not only this step helps us and other future citizens. For few months, she might take a break if this rule is there and again go back to work. Without this rule, she will have to continue working and can not think about taking a break.

"Every H4 spouse should go through a background verification process where the experience he/she has is verified, the company necessity is verified, the company should determine whether the candidate is a good fit, get the documents of the primary h1b spouse to determine the eligibility and then be given the position. Only after getting the legitimate FT job, the company should apply for H4-EAD for the need that they have. That way, only really needed H4 candidates will be hired, will get EAD and then also legal candidates. If not, the system will be corrupted again.

There are a few H4 to H1 applications that are picked this time in the lottery and F1 students that invest in the US schools have lost to these body shopping companies. These H4-H1 cases shouldnt be approved because most of them take money from candidates to apply for H1b and dont really have future job. If H4 EAD is granted, these body shopping markets will place these candidates with huge career gaps in contractual positions. So, apart from the Full time US companies hiring these people and applying for EADs for them along with background verification(basically work experience verification, which was their last project etc), there also needs to be a rule to say, no H4 EAD candidate will be hired in contractual or contract to hire positions or engage himself/herself in any kind of client relationships from vendors( I mean, employer-vendor-client or employer-vendor relations or vendor-client relations even for corp-corp,W2 corp, kind of jobs), because I have seen cases where even the contract to hire positions get hired by fake experience and after 1 year the candidate becomes critical to the company and the company let goes of work experience process too. Getting that 1 awesome break is very difficult and H4 EADs will have it easy through these contracting positions without genuine experience.

Most of the spouses are women who end up sitting idle at home even though they are immensely talented. This has led to either both couple moving out of country or just sacrifice dependent's career for the sake of staying in the US. 

I feel this situation should be turned around by passing a suitable law which will safeguard interests of US citizen as well as give some relief to the helplessness to these H4 dependents. I welcome this rule and hope it is passed soon. Lets all work together for the growth of this economy. ",0,0,2014-07-11T00:00:00-04:00
"From 2003 to 2007, both me & my wife were working at reputed telecommunication companies in India. To fulfill my dream of higher education at a world class university, I started my Masters in Computer Science at Stanford in 2007. My wife accompanied with me on F-2 visa, with the confidence that her electronics engineering degree and 4 years of work experience will be more than sufficient to get her a quality job.

It has been 7 years since then, and my wife hasn't yet found a job which matches her qualification & career aspirations. After I started working & earning, my wife pursued MBA at Santa Clara University, and is graduating soon. But still it is very difficult for her to find a job because most employers do not want to sponsor work visa. Shortage of H1B visa is making it even harder. Several companies were ready to offer her a position, but later retracted, citing work authorization as the reason.

In spite of good qualifications, experience, and even a MBA degree from a US university, my wife is still yearning to work. I think she is very talented & hard working and will be an asset to whatever company she works for.

Our story is not an exception. There are so many Indian & Chinese spouses who suffer silently for several years because they are very qualified & want to contribute to the society & economy, but cannot because their Green Cards are stuck in the queue. Giving them authorization to work seems like the right thing to do, not just for the benefit of these spouses, but also to benefit the society & economy.

"Dear Sir,

I support because it is very beneficial for US Economy in several ways like:

1.As EAD(Employment Authorization) will give H-4 Dependents right to work, thus they will pay taxes and contribute to US economy. Most of them are highly skilled, so there skill can be used by the corporates for the development and growth.

2. Passing this rule will also help to retain lots of H1-B talent in USA. Due to long waiting time for GC(about 10-20 years) many H1B’s with high education from USA are migrating to other countries like Canada, Australia and their home countries, as their spouses(high skilled with many having high education from USA) can’t work. Not able to work status of H1B spouses is also putting lot of financial pressure on families.

3. Passing this rule will also create more jobs, As EAD will allow H-4’s to start their own business, thus increasing employment opportunities.

4. Passing this rule will not flood job market and leave less options for the American Citizens, as this proposed rule RIN 1615 – AB92(Employment Authorization for certain H-4 Dependent Spouses) clearly states that : The Department of Homeland Security proposes to extend the availability of Employment Authorization to certain H-4 dependent spouses of principle H1-B non-immigrants. The extension would be limited to H-4 dependent spouses of principal H1-B non-immigrants who are in the process of seeking lawful permanent resident status through employment. This population will include those H-4 dependent spouses of H1-B non-immigrants if the H1-B non-immigrants either the beneficiaries of an approved immigrant petition for Alien worker(I-140) or who have been granted an extension of their authorized period of admission in the United States under the American competitiveness in the 21st century act of 2000(AC21), as amended by 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act. This Regulatory change would lessen any potential economic burden to the H1-B principal and H-4 dependent spouse during the transition from non-immigrant to lawful permanent resident status, furthering the goals of attracting and retaining high-skilled foreign workers. 

5. In any of the anti-immigration arguments anywhere in the world, there doesn't exist any single proof that adding high skilled immigrants goes to reduce the wages, increase unemployment and/or harm interest of the citizens of that country. This does applies to illegal immigrants but not those who are waiting to get the work authorization in right way and being law abiding. In fact, implementing this rule helps government to gain more tax money, generate more employment as they  increase need at home while away. 

Please ignore the organized fobia against the hard working immigrants coming to this country with a hope and urge to achieve by the means this country offers. Encouraging policies to these hard working high skilled immigrants will only prosper this country than do any harm to the interest of average hardworking citizen.

"Subject: Regarding the proposed rule for H4 – EAD for spouses of H1b immigrants

I have been following this rule from past 3 years . First , I would like to congratulate DHS/USICS and OMB for taking time to initiate a process to discuss the pain of “Legal” Immigrants.

There are countries like Australia , Singapore , Canada , United Kingdom …. which need skilled jobs  and have far relaxed   Immigration rules for “Spouse of Legal immigrants “ as compared to USA. In order to be competitive in the 21st Century , USA has to invest time and money to re-organize its broken immigration system . 

I will share my example. My Brother and Sister in law – both are highly educated , one works in IT Company as Vice President and the other works in Financial Institute  as Accounting Team Lead  . My Brother had a very job offer from a very reputed firm in USA . He did not accept the offer  because his wife would have been on H4 visa . He has opted for Australia and to my surprise , they both got  Australian permanent residence in 6 months . Now , my wife ( who is on H4 ) is telling me that we should also think about other countries if this country does not care about “Legal Immigrants”.

This Rule is my only hope to continue staying in this country. I am with my current company for last 5 years ,  I love my job , they pay me well and they like my work . It's a Win – Win Situation for everybody – My Company is getting what they want , I am getting rewarded , I am paying tax  and as a good law abiding citizen – community is also happy.  

However , till now I have not understood why H4 are not allowed to work. I am reading various comments and many people don't understand that this rule is for Legal immigrants who have been paying social security tax , Medicare tax etc.  Also , they don't understand is the restrictions on H4 visa that Law has imposed….H4 visa holders cannot study , cannot volunteer ….so why should one leave his/her country where they have freedom and come to USA to be caged inside a house?

There are some comments  who have questioned – why cannot H4 apply for H1. To answer the question …..All H4 are not highly skilled ( which means Doctors / Engineers ) and hence they cannot apply for H1. Period.  This also doesn't mean they are uneducated. My Wife is a MBA in marketing  and was a product manager which is not a H1 ( highly skilled  job ) but is a white collar job.

To conclude , this rule has been long due.  For Every rule , there will be Pros / Cons .  I feel , For this rule , there are lot of Pros and they outweigh Cons.   USICS / OMB has taken a step in the right direction and should further invest time to speed up this process .

"This is a first incremental good step that the Government is proposing to take to help the legally resident non-immigrants who have been stuck in the green card limbo for many years due to lack of inaction by Congress to take up the Comprehensive Immigration Reform.

Hopefully this time around this rule gets enacted as the last time this was proposed in the 2010-2011 time frame, there was no progress made. Don't want to sound pessimistic, but until we see this rule happen in reality, I am keeping my fingers crossed. As a suggestion, why can't the Government extend this rule to say that H1B visa holders who have an approved I140 are eligible to apply for I485 even if the priority date is not current, as this will enable the beneficiary and dependents to obtain EAD and AP. I don't see a reason why this rule can't be implemented (unless Congress has the authority to enact this...I am not a constitutional legal expert, so not sure) for the benefit of legal non-immigrants who have been waiting for their priority dates to become current for many years, but unless Congress changes the law this long wait will not change as the current law is not in sync with the present situation for supply and demand.",0,0,2014-06-10T00:00:00-04:00

I am not sure if I am can settle in this country as her career is picked up and her employer can send her outside to one of their subsidiaries. My green card process is almost stalled and I am not sure when at least I will get my EAD. 

I am waiting for this rule for longtime, if not may be sooner or later I might have to leave as I have to also respect my wife's choice if she want to pursue her career if not she has to convert to H4 and sit idle.

MySelf: Solutions architect career stalled and cant move to any other company and company is going to split lot of speculations going about re-organization got my I-140 and not sure where I will end-up.

My Wife: Marketing Manager with a new company which is growing fast has head office in Germany may move to other country as her employer is not willing to loose her. 
 
I am also concerned about the time line of implementation, as I see lot of rules made to final rule after one year once the comment period ended. Not sure what would be the time line for this would be once the comment responses finishes. 
for past four years this rules sitting at OMB desk and again I assume this one will go again to OMB and not sure when approval will come and final rule will be effective.

"It has become alarmingly clear that our Government and Big Business will destroy the ability of American citizens to make a living by importing more and more foreign workers to take the jobs Americans so desperately need.

"Granting certian H4 visa holders work authorization to work is good but very narrow in scope.  It has been mentioned only H4 visa holders whose spouse H1B have an approved I-140 or whose spouse H1B visa has been extended due to AC21 act would eventually apply.

What of H4 holders whose spouse H1B Labor certification has been submitted and awaiting disposition by the department of labor?  i have issues with the AC21 act because I have a friend whose labor certification was submitted in the 6th year of his H1B and still awaiting approval by the department of labor.  This H1B visa holder cannot have his H1B extended if his labor certification is not approved by the time his H1B status expires.  What happens to his house on H4?  She will also not be eligible for work authorization?.  But on the other hand a h4 holder whose spouse H1B labor certifcaition was submitted 365 days before H1B status expiration, and for some reason have not heard back from the department of labor would be entitled to employment authorization.  Is this fair at all?

H4 visa holders go through a lot of emotional strains because they cannot work and are limited to certain things.  My suggestion is that since submission of labor certification is the first step in the green card process, once that has been submitted, the h4 holder of the principal H1B should be entitled to work authoriation.  Additionally, for the case i mentioned whereby the H1B visa holder's labor certification was submitted in the 6th of H1B visa, the AC21 should be changed to allow such H1B visa holder to extend his H1B until apporval/denial of the labor certification.

Having said the above, the US should  do more for H4 visa holders by allowing them to work.  I mean all H4 visa holders should be alloweed to work. The work authorization should be for say 2 years and be subsequent for renewal depending on the principal H1B visa holder status.

•	This is giving amnesty: Just to make things clear, this rule is NOT related to giving amnesty to illegal aliens. This is about equal rights to families who have been in US legally for almost 6 years or more. This rule will give much needed relief to H1b families who have been waiting for such a long time for their green card.
•	This is going to take jobs from American workers: For last many years, H1b applications have been going to lottery. This means, there were jobs to be filled but companies were not able to find suitable American worker to fill up the job. This rule will only add about 1% of total unemployed people in US right now. 
•	Immigrants are cheap labor: From my knowledge and experience most of the H1b have avg. salary of 70-80k. I have been in US for almost 10 years on H1b, I can tell you for a fact that my salary is at par (if not more) with all my American friends with same level of experience. 
Here are some of the benefits that this rule will have for H1b families and US economy: 
•	Strengthen H1b families’ ties to US.
•	These new highly skilled worker will pay more in taxes which will help boost US economy in coming years. 
•	New H4 EAD workers could be able to start new business which will create new job in US. 
•	Financially secure families will spend more money on cars, homes, stocks and consumer goods etc, which will benefit US economy. 
For me personally, it will help my wife in so many different way it just hard to put it in word. She will be able to work and open up small business she always dreamt off. This will also give her more independence and more social life which she misses right now.

I strongly appreciate your leadership in bringing this rule to a reality!!

This rule is an absolute necessity in this 21st century and is more humanitarian. With the current prevailing law, all of these H4 visa holders are forced to stay back home and not allowed to work in the US. I can talk on my behalf and family on the pain these H4 visa holders have to go though mentally.

My wife has a Masters in Bio Chemistry and also holds a Post Grad degree in Pharmacy Management from India. She was working in one of the top Pharmacy companies in the World back in India. Since we got married, she decided to quit her job and came to the US in 2009 with the hopes of building the American Dream. Very unfortunately, since H4 holders cannot work, my wife was also forced to stay at home. She has been staying home without the eligibility to apply for work for the past 5 years. She has really wasted most part of her young carrier due to this situation! 

It really makes sense for this rule to target only a specific class of H4 visa holders, where the primary H1 visa holder’s Green Card processing has started. Those individuals will anyway become permanent residents in future, so giving such H4 visa holders an EAD with the conditions specified in the rule is the right thing to do!

This might not be  large population.These children may already be in college and their parents have to pay high tuition because they are disqualified for scholarships. and some states even disqualify them for instate tuition( as H4) if they travel with their AP.  These children are going to use their capability to supplement some income for the family while gaining internship experience if they are granted EAD. otherwise they suffer in two ways because of H4 status-(curse?). they cann't work, and they can't gain precious internship experience. they will be disadvantaged to other kids when they graduate. Why not let them use all their potentials and better prepared in future life and work in this country they might contribute more.

If they don't get Green card at graduation they will have to re start their own waiting cycle like their parents did many many years ago-H1B-LC-140 485-------

"This rule is a very good approach for those who are on non-immigrant status of H-4.  Please implement as soon as possible. For those who are holding H1Bs their spouses are generally people who hold Bachelor's or Master's degree, when they have authorization to work, it is going to help government collect more taxes and also take out the burden on those families who only have one income. I would like to additionally comment on J-1 visa holders. I came here in USA when I was seventeen, pursued my Bachelor’s and Master’s in USA, worked on H1B. (8 years) Then I was married to a J1 holder. My status converted to J-2 holder, I had work authorization.  My husband is a medical doctor who received his internal medicine and cardiology fellowship in USA (7 years) doing a waiver now.(H1B currently) My status then changed to an H4 which did not allow me to work. I am really appreciative of this proposal. However, can you please also consider an automated process of getting a green card where you have received your degree from USA and been here legally for so many years? When I was converted to an H4 I felt like for 3 years I can do nothing but stay home. If only I had work authorization I would have pursued getting a job and my education would not go to waste. I really wish that for people who have done their education here worked here there was a way to get into the green card process easier. I am not suggesting that it can be given out easily but being considered would make a difference. My point is that I and my husband have been here for 13 years legally, still preparing paperwork to get to the green card process and hopefully we would be approved once my husband’s waiver is completed in 2 years. I wish this process was eased somehow but proposed rule also helps. ",0,0,2014-05-28T00:00:00-04:00

7.Why don’t these dependent visa holders transfer to H-1B: Providing H-1B sponsorship is not cheap for an employer both in terms of time and money. An employee thus is generally expected to showcase his/her skill set by working for them before they can request that sponsorship. It is not possible for H-4 visa holders to work for any employer even for a short duration so that they can demonstrate their skills and request the sponsorship. Thus, this amendment will be a much needed relief for those skilled spouses on H-4 and will help them find employers that can use their skill sets.


Response – This is not totally true. So many candidates get jobs first and then apply for H1b. Even now, really talented spouses are still getting jobs and applying for H1bs. Example are medical professionals, construction professionals etc. Only in IT industry, since visa fraud is totally negated now, the h4 to h1 is not possible(which is good for clean IT industry now). So, most spouses waiting for this EAD, could be from IT. By granting this EAD, we will be back to same fraudulent activities etc. Our question is, what is the plan for most of these H4 spouses? Some of them have huge gaps in career by now. How do they prove they are skilled and the employers need them? What is the last place they worked at(because generally corporations need this)? Large corporations will hire you anyway with/without EAD. So, the fear is that most of the h4 EADs are mostly waiting for EAD to join IT consulting again and potentially frivolous employment will be entertained again as it was in 2008. So, more conditions on proving the education qualifications, having masters from US schools, employer applying and not the candidate, employer proving the similar documentation as H1b is a necessity. Also, the people that are not eligible as per masters can go back to school just like how medical professionals do.


Counter response: Who mandated that a spouse of H1B should also be in the STEM field?? What about spouses that are teachers, artists, fashion designers, sonogram technicians, sales and marketing professionals, entrepreneurs, small business owners, beauticians, bank tellers, chefs.. there are so many other professions which may not even qualify for H1B visas.. please keep that in mind before making an ignorant comment about how H4s should convert to H1B?

"""I support this petition with following supporting comments"".

1) Recently US is facing ""brain drain"" meaning - high tech employees from all IT or science fields are leaving US because their spouse cannot work. Naturally they will feel boring and their personal life will be impacted. This has provide momentum to scientists moving back to China, India, Europe, Canada, Australia etc after taking masters or PhD degrees from US.

Their much required skills are sold outside and we get ONLY university money at max. Their future/present top notch researches are sold in millions out of US (in form of new patents/products) creating huge employment outside of US which we can have it in the country.

2) Petition clearly states employment authorization to I-140 approved people meaning for them whose permanent residency is in progress. These families are those who 

a) pays regular taxes since they earn industry standard or above wages (h1b cannot be granted without it) 
b) increases our high tech job market (example google, yahoo and list goes on..)
c) least found in criminal offenses - we have not heard h1b people in terrorism, misdemeanor or other kind of nuisances due to their education level

AND they will be US Citizens after 7-8 years ANYHOW after their permanent residency application(I-140) is approved.

3) Current rule says - once I-485 is approved for H1b employee (next level to I-140), dependent H4 spouse can work. New proposed rule only says they can do the same at I-140 level. It is making simply 3-4 years before for them.

There is no huge change in laws but impact is HUGE since families will hold together on the legal path of being lawful citizens.

4) Final supportive comment - we see everywhere Government is favoring mainly labor group by making 11 million illegal/undocumented workers legal. How much tax or technology we will get from them comparing to H1bs which are LEGAL now and in future and draws millions of dollar tax money NOW and in future too with added technology and research.

5) Statistics support that Microsoft or NASA or any technology giant, we have 60 to 70% skilled workers immigrants which come via H1B.

If my wife (or any H4 holder) is given an opportunity to utilize their skills, before they lose their edge will be very beneficial in every way. On the other hand, there are so many H1B people who came to USA very recenty from countries other than India, have gotten their Green Cards and their spouses are working.

"I would like to voice strong support for offering employment authorization for H4 dependent spouses. I feel that the proposal strikes a good balance to the number of people added to the workforce by restricting it to individuals who already have long term plans to settle in the US. The spouses of these individuals will eventually get employment authorization anyways and allowing them to work earlier creates a win win situation for everyone as it provides more skilled labor to the employers while at the same time these individuals also become tax paying members of the society.

As the H1B program mandates H1B visa holders are highly educated and skilled workers and typically their spouses are also highly skilled and educated as well. With a lot of foreign educated spouses holding STEM or other advanced masters level degrees it becomes a civil responsibility to provide jobs to these individuals who have shown exceptional effort to attaining these credentials and who are willing to prove their worth to the market.

I personally would be very much interested in this rule being implemented as it helps my personal situation as well. I currently work for a large National Laboratory funded by the DOE my spouse also holds an MS degree but is unable to apply for jobs due to her visa limitations.Though I personally have long term plans to settle in the US, these plans are under serious reconsideration due to the work limitation imposed by the H4 visa of my spouse.

"Our family strongly support this new rule. Many H1-B workers have their i140 approved while waiting for green card quota.  The waiting can take 5-15 years. Their spouses couldn't work with EAD for that 5-15 years. Many people are moving to Australia and Canada for this reason so it's easier to have a normal working life for the whole family. This new rule, if become reality, will decrease instability for a lot of legal immigrant families and strengthen the US economy because when families are stabilized, they are more willing to spend money on houses, cars, to take a loan and open a business, to spend on education, etc. 
This policy is long overdue. A large majority of these H1-B workers along with their H-4 spouses are advanced degree holders (many from US schools) in STEM fields. The large pool of talent can be kept here in the US instead of flowing to competing economies. ",0,0,2014-05-28T00:00:00-04:00

The first thing companies ask before they even proceed to evaluating a candidate is if they require H1 sponsorship. Filling these positions enables these companies to get their products to market faster, realize increased revenue that can be invested in new initiatives and consequently create more jobs. 

This is a win-win. A no-brainer.",0,0,2014-05-22T00:00:00-04:00
"Dear Sir/Madam,

I support this proposed rule to extend eligibility for employment authorization to H-4 dependent spouses of H-1B non-immigrants if the H-1B non-immigrants have either been granted status pursuant to sections 106(a) and (b) of AC21 or are the beneficiaries of an approved Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (Form I-140).

This rule only applies to spouses of H-1B visa holders that either have their visas extended under AC21 or have obtained an approved Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (I-140)  and not getting their turn because of the lack of visa but actually on their way to become permanent residence. This is the absolutely right thing to do. 

There are some of the main reasons/benefits which I want to point out here:

1.Good for US companies and corporations:  
   a.Most of the h4 visa holders are educated in Science, technology and engineering fields. Some of them have the required experience to serve the companies who are looking for talented people in these fields. If H4 visa holders are allowed to work, then they can fill those jobs within US, for which companies are waiting for next visa cycles to bring foreign workers.
   b.Minimize the disruptions to US business employing H1B works that would result if such workers were required to leave the United States because the spouse cannot work. The primary reason for this rule is to retain the high skilled person in US.
   c.If US companies are able to utilize skills and education of H4 visa holder then companies don’t need to spend on H1B visa petition, training, etc. There will be less hassle to apply the work visa and they don’t have to go through the expensive and complex process of H1B filing.
2. Good for US economy: 
     a.Entrepreneurship: There are several reports on entrepreneurial activity which indicates that immigrants are more likely to start a new business ventures/ companies and employ citizens thus creating more jobs. Allowing H4 visa holders to get EAD will provide a great chance of bulk employment opportunities.
     b.Tax, Social security and Medicare:  Allowed H4 visa holders will be paying taxes and making contribution towards the social security and Medicare funds. This will boost these funds which are major expense part of US GDP. Allowing H4 visa holder to get the EAD will offset the aging of the native-born workforce and balance the social security contribution and expenses.
     c.This rule will create more tax revenue, more consumer buying power and eventually more jobs. Allowing EAD to H4 visa holder will give these families extra financial support which eventually invests in US economy in terms of more buying capacity, investing money in long term and purchasing new homes. All these activities will help the economy, real estate sector and create more jobs. 
3.Family and society issue: There are families of high skilled workers from certain countries who are waiting for their green card from more than 10 years. They are already part of the US society. Most of these people are going to be the permanent residence when they get their turn. They should get the relief and spouse of the high skilled worker should be able to support their families financially and raise their children sufficiently and contribute towards neighborhood and US society overall by utilizing their education and skills. 
     People are not only looking for comfortable life but they also need life of dignity and self-dependence. The financial independence of any individual gives them freedom of choice and is directly related to their self-esteem.
4.A women issue: Most of the H4 visa holders are the women who have moved to US to accompany their husband and support their family. They generally have good educational background and sometimes the industry experience. When these woman can’t seek the employment for longer term (in some case the wait is more than 10 years), they become dependent on their husbands. This kind of situation not only creates depression and frustration among these women but also make them vulnerable to fight against any domestic issue and violence. These educated women who are living in US from long time and intend to live here, should get the right to seek the employment and be able to live here financially independent. 

 I sincerely and humbly request USICS to pass this rule as soon as possible without any further delay.

We came back in 2005, we were able to get the perm in 2 months but now due to the back log in employment based visas we are still unable to file 485. I am a lawyer from India.

"This proposed rule should be WITHDRAWN, due to both policy and technical reasons.

First, the proposed rule would add an estimated 100,000 new guest workers to the labor force in the first year and an additional 35,000 every year after that--when the USA is already awash in unemployed workers that are American citizens.
Second, in a remarkable miscue, the additional visas would not count against the visa cap in the category of job the new guest workers would pursue.  This is a wildly over-generous approach.
Third, the U.S. already brings in 700,000 guest workers every year in addition to 1 million permanent workers.  Again, the USA is awash with unemployed workers; we should not be making adding huge numbers of foreign workers, even legal foreign workers, to make the job market even more challenging.
Fifth, despite the title of this proposed rule,  the new visas would NOT be limited to spouses of temporary H-1B workers who have been approved for Legal Permanent Residence status. The Regulation states:
""The form is being amended to add a new class of aliens eligible to apply for employment authorization: H-4 dependent spouses of H-1B nonimmigrants if the H-1B nonimmigrants are either the beneficiaries of an approved Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker or have been granted an extension of their authorized period of admission in the United States under sections 106(a) and (b) of the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000 (AC21), as amended by the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act.""
Sixth, there is no general shortage of high-skilled labor to justify this regulation.  Why are we pursuing it?
Seventh, the new visas would apply to all U.S. occupations, regardless of whether there is a need for more job seekers or not.  This proposed rule DOES NOT solve the problems it purports to, but instead is a ""shotgun"" approach where a very narrow approach would be appropriate.  
Eighth, the H-1b visa-to-green card process is problematic in and of itself, with firms being coached on how to ""not find a qualified and interested American worker"";  This perverse incentive must be fought against, not encouraged.
Finally, the sponsored employee is faced with years of near-indentured servitude, tied to a particular position with one company for years.

In sum, this proposed rule is a very poor example of public policy.  It is deceptively titled to encourage passage by misleading the American people.  It does not actually solve the particular problem it claims to.  It opens the doors, willy-nilly, for an entirely new class of immigrant workers.  It will make the employment situation worse within the USA, not better.  The proposed rule offers a ""shotgun"" approach where extreme precision would be appropriate.

I was an early stage employee in my company. I started my job right out of school, I was unmarried then. I worked passionately, together with my team we took our company to great heights. The company grew both in terms of revenue & employee count. My employer considers me a significant contributor to company's success. Today company has gone public and its 600+ strong. Its a diverse mix of people. By our hard work we were able to create hundreds of jobs within US. We have potential to accelerate the growth even further and create 1000s of new jobs, only if H1B employees like myself can focus on right things. 

I got married couple of years ago & myself being on H1B - my spouse came on H4. She is very well qualified herself with substantial work experience in a very niche field. But due to the current dependent visa law, she can not work. The frustration of not being able to contribute to her family & lack of fulfillment is taking toll on her. For me to its difficult to see her aspirations getting buried with time. I find it a dual loss for US economy. Its not just her not being able to contribute to success of an employer with her unique set of skills, its me too not being able to give fully to my job as I divide my attention between work and personal stress created by our visa situation.

"I've read a few of these and the lion's share of those endorsing it are the ones who stand to gain.  A common assertion is this will help American business since there aren't enought qualified Americans. Also that they can't take American's jobs and that employers first must make an exhaustive search for an American fiest.  I've also read that this must be take place to get the ""Best and Brightest"" here to America. There's also the parrotted statement that having then here create's jobs. Also many are stating that this will help the plight of the H1-B's, e.g. allow more money per househoold.

Let's examine these points.

First: Not enough qualified Americans.  This myth has been spread by the CoC, big business looking for cheapier and cheaper labor, politicians benefitting by helping big business and their lapdogs, the mainstream media. This has been debunked time and time again.

Here's a VERY abbreviated list 
http://www.nationalreview.com/article/378334/what-stem-shortage-steven-camarota
http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13467
httt and brightest myth://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/03/the-myth-of-the-science-and-engineering-shortage/284359/
http://www.epi.org/publication/bp359-guestworkers-high-skill-labor-market-analysis/

http://www.redstate.com/2014/06/19/h1b-visas-bad-policy-bad-business/

And if that were really true, STEM workers income would have been steadily rising, when in actuality, it has remained stagnant since the 2000's.  My own personal example, when I can find work, it's contract and about 2/3s of what I was making back in the 2000's.  If we're that hard, how is that possible.  I guess I just don't understand the laws of supply and demand.

Second:  Employers must first search for a qualified local employee and the H1-B can not take an American's job and employers.

False and false.  They must do that if they're sponsoring for a green card, not just to hire a H1-B - read the above links - and there are ways around that as well. And in any ""At will"" state, you can be replaced at any time, and in a lot of these cases, the US employee is forced to change his cheaper, less knowlegable replacement in order to get a severance, a choice that many must take.

http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9248996/This_IT_worker_had_to_train_an_H_1B_replacement?pageNumber=1

Third: Best and Brightest.

Really?  You believe that?  Most, as illustrated by the above and below links are hardly that.  In most cases, they're less knowledgable than those their replacing.  I've worked with many, and while a few are more than competent, the majority are about as good as any American grad from a tech college.  But on the plus side for business, they are CHEAPER! And we already have a visa for the ""Best and Brightest""  It's called the O-1.  Look it up!  The iH1-Bs are at best what the sabermetric guys call 0 WAR players.  In other words 0 wins above replacement.

Fourth:  Having guest workers creates jobs.
I've heard that, time and again.  Always from some ""business leader"" who wants even more cheap labor. I have yet to see any concrete evidence of this.  The only jobs I think this will create will be for domestics, dog walkers and nanny's for the H1-Bs.  I'd really like if someone could prove this to me.

Fifth:  This will help the plight of the H1-Bs and their families.

So, they're admitting that they aren't as well paid, and in reality are basically indentured servants since they're tied to the company that filled out the LCA. Here's a few more facts.  We gve away 85,000 of these per year, good for 6 years, and can be extended to 10, with no green card needed to be offered. Do the math.  And the govenment has NO IDEA of how many are here either legally or have over stayed thir visas.  

And while it may help their plight, I can guarantee this one thing, if there's a 100,000 spouses allowed to work, it will put 100,000 Americans out of work

What about the US citizens w st, present and future who have worked and contributed their whole lives to this country and it's tax base.

Well, the POTUS, CofC, Gang of Eight, Silicon Valley and Big Business has this to say to you ""Screw you, there's money to be made here"".",0,0,2014-07-14T00:00:00-04:00
I am currently on H4 Dependent Visa and i approved this rule as it will allow me to work in this country and be independent again,0,0,2014-05-16T00:00:00-04:00
"This is a great proposal. It has been unfair for H4 dependants to stay put at home despite being qualified just because of their visa status. If H1 employees contribute to the US economy, why would their spouses not be allowed to work? It is time this insane regulation came to an end.",0,0,2014-05-15T00:00:00-04:00
"This is really a good news, My wife is going to be on H4 and she had good experience in IT industry. I was thinking to leave her to home country to pursue her career as no one is willing to sponsor her H1 and have lottery predictions for all upcoming years. I am sure this will also bring down the number of VISA’s to be filed next year quota and will help some other people. 

It’s a great initiative but please need to consider couple of changes. 

(*) in current EAD process for e.g. L2 EAD( I-765)  form it takes about 60-90 days to processing, there has to be a chance for premium processing for L2 EAD or H4 EAD. 
This would help greatly to the people who are in USA already and can begin\pursue their career without much gap in their career  as if they are travelling from home country to USA.
(*)  It may be good idea to give the H4 EAD for those also who don’t have I-140 approved like L1 spouses, if L2 spouses can start working as soon as EAD is in hand then why not H4 spouse.  It will be a transparent to all as dependent. 

Hopefully this get read by officer and consider it as request to do so.

"Not all Spouses should be eligible for EAD. It should be more prioritized with additional conditions like, 
# Is H1 Candidate Graduate from US University ?

# Is spouse who will claim EAD , Educationally highly qualified or not? may be Graduate from US Universities (Not community colleges) as an In state   student .... Which would generate some revenue for local universities.

# EAD validity for limited time like 6months-1yr. They have to prove that they are working legally and are paying taxes , to be eligible for EAD  extention. They may go to Local  Secretary of State office and provide their paystubs or W2 forms and extend their EAD.

# Without Restricting proof of work on new EAD Candidates will increase unemployment in lower middle class. People may start doing hard jobs or may run in home business without paying proper taxes to the government. So
restricting validity time and proof of W2's will ensure quality of work and improves economy.


Considering above conditions will ensure EAD to only well qualified candidates and also help generate revenue for improving US Economy

But, if the job markets are flooded with foreigners who are willing to undercut prevailing wages - as the H1b, L1 and B1 visas have done - and you KNOW that by and large that is true - then this will be a disaster for US Citizens, especially young workers starting their careers, STEM workers and older workers.

"I fully support this rule to be enacted. Those who are against it, claiming to be afraid of H4 holder taking way job opportunities, making the economy worse. Let's be reasonable, we are living in a real competitive world, it is not like if H4 are not allowed to work, those jobs will all go to the unqualified. The truth is that most H4 holders are highly educated women, allowing them to work is a good way to appreciate their talents, not only boosting the economy but also giving this group a sense of belonging. The reason this country is standing on the top of the world is that it is good at attracting valuable professionals who contribute enormously to the society in terms of technology and economic development, it doesn't make any sense in hanging many qualified H4 holders to dry, at the same time, spending tons of money on seeking talents.

"Please, please, do not pass this as it is with a blanket EADs for the sake of unemployed/underemployed Americans, students. Almost 1 in 2 graduated students are underemployed. We will be doing a great injustice by depriving our own kids of jobs by increasing the competition with these new Spouse EADs.

Limit the EADs to only professions with labor shortage, i.e. High tech field. We should not open this employment to any other field. Period. Only to high tech jobs.
Also give EADs only to people who have been here on H-1b for a long time and have filed for an extension extension using AC-21, and have an approved I-140. Do not give Blanket EADs to anyone with an approved I-140. This will put a realistic limit on these EADs and create an upper bound for these and give EADs to only those who have been here for a long time.

I am from India , and I know the kind of rampant fraud going on in H-1b system. People sit on benches without any job, and body shoppers are plenty faking resumes. Even graduate schools have become a money making machine, accepting massive number of students(Mostly from Hyderabad). I am talking about thousands here(Example: Northwestern Polytechnic university (NPU), Fremont).There is massive fraud going on right in front of our eyes. I do not want to give blanket EADs to spouses without any long work history of the underlying spouse.

Please only give EADs to dependents, based on H-1b stay of six years and an AC-21 extension beyond six years.
Remove just an approved I-140, regardless of the number of years on H-1b as a criteria for giving EADs to spouses.

I hope, you will consider this. Predominant support for this law are from Indians, who will benefit from this very law. Please consider the plight of unemployed Americans, and the rampant fraud this proposal will bring and limit it to people who will deserve it, not to everyone with a I-140 approval.

"II strongly support the EAD for H-4 rule and my primary reason is somewhat different from the other comments that I came across.
I work for a large Seattle based software giant, we hire hundreds of Masters and PhD graduates from American universities every year. They are of different nationalities and during hiring the strict rule is selecting candidates based on merit and not on any other factor including country of origin. Eventually the company needs to sponsor H-1B visa for the non-American employees and due to the recent high demand and lottery system many of our H-1B petitions have not been accepted. To counteract with this situation our company is now investing Millions of dollars to expand its office in Vancouver, Canada to accommodate those engineers/researchers who could not stay in US due to visa issues. A large number of our existing H-1B visa holders are also keen to move to Vancouver given the easier immigration laws of Canada which enables their spouses to work. Isn't this a loss for the American economy?
I guess with H-4 EAD holders there will be a bigger pool to hire talented people from within US without having to go through the immigration hassle and also it will stop many H-1B holders moving to countries like Canada.
I am an American citizen by birth, my parents came to USA for their graduate studies and this country has given them everything that they had dreamed of.

Subject: Comment Supporting DHS Docket No. USCIS–2010– 0017 ""Extend the availability of employment authorization to certain H–4 dependent spouses of principal H–1B""

Dear MS. Dawkins,

My name is Siva Kamesh. I have an MBA in Finance from a top American University and work for a leading Automobile Manufacturer in Detroit. I am currently on H1B visa which ends in August 2014 since the maximum allowed time of 6 years is up.
 
My wife who works for the same company had applied for a green card 4 years back and we had hoped to get our green card this year but because of long EB2 wait time, the application is still pending. 

I have invested a lot in my Master's education and am very excited to be working here. We even bought a home in Michigan thinking that this is where we would like to settle down. But now given all the uncertainties, since my career is in a limbo we are seriously considering moving to another country.

DHS Docket No. USCIS–2010– 0017 ""Extend the availability of employment authorization to certain H–4 dependent spouses of principal H–1B"" would be a very good solution to all our problems. With the H4 employment authorization I can continue my job while we are waiting in line for our green card. So, I request you to consider granting EAD for H4 - dependent spouses as per DHS Docket No. USCIS–2010– 0017.

I would welcome an opportunity to meet with you to discuss in detail. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Sincerely,

"America is treated as land of opportunity and it indeed is proven with many no of immigrant workers with their entrepreneurial skills invested into American economy. Many of these folks have indeed come to this country on H1B visa’s and were able to accomplish their dreams. However with restriction to their spouses for an inability to work is really an unfortunate thing, although these people are equally good with their skills.  While most other employment visas such as L, E, and TN allow spouses to obtain a work authorization, the H1 does not allow their dependents (H4 Visa holders) to work, until they get a green card. This will be a value add to American economy providing even more skillful people readily available willing to contribute their part to this economy.

I am opposed to this.  We do not need any additional guest workers or Visas.  We have plenty of skilled workers in the US that are unemployed and can fill these positions.

H4 has made her unproductive for past 2.5 years. The fact that there is no movement in green card dates makes the H4 talent go waste and adds more pressure on the spouse to leave USA.
